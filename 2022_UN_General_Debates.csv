 BRA_77_2022,"Statement by the President of the Republic of Brazil at the opening of the 
General Debate of the 77th UNGA  
New York City, September 20, 2022  
 
Mr. Csaba Korösi, President of the Seventy -seventh General Assembly of 
the United Nations,  
Mr, António Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations, whom I 
have the renewed pleasure of addressing in our common language,  
Heads of State, Government and Delegations,  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
I begin by congratulating you, Ambassador Csaba Korösi, on your elec tion 
as president of this General Assembly. You can be sure to count on the support 
of Brazil.  
The theme chosen for this General Debate revolves around a concept that 
perfectly applies to the moment we live: a watershed.  
Mr. President,  
Our collective resp onsibility, at this General Meeting, is to understand the 
scope of the challenges that make up this watershed moment. And, from there, 
build responses that pull their strength from the objectives that are common to 
all of us.  
The task is not simple. But a s things are presented, we have no alternative. 
 
   This effort must begin within each of our countries. First of all, it is what 
we do at the domestic level that gives the measure of the authority with which 
we act internationally.  
Allow me speak from my cou ntry's perspective.   
When Brazil expresses its positions on  the  public health agenda, we do so 
with the authority of a government that, during the Covid -19 pandemic, made 
all the efforts to save lives and preserve jobs. Like many other countries, we 
drove our attention, from the very onset, to ensuring emergency finan cial 
assistance to those most in need. Our goal was to protect families' income so 
that they could face the economic hardships  resulting from  the pandemic. We 
benefited more than 68 million people, equivalent to 1/3 of our population.  
In tandem, we launch ed a broad vaccination program, including domestic 
production of vaccines. Our nation has more than 210 million people and we 
already have more than 80% of the population vaccinated against Covid -19. All 
were vaccinated voluntarily, respecting individual f reedom.  
Likewise, as far as the economy is concerned, Brazil has the power of a 
country that, for the sake of sustainable and inclusive growth, has been 
implementing reforms to attract investment and improve the livelihood of its 
population.  
In my admini stration, we uprooted the systemic corruption that existed in 
the country . Between 2003 and 2015, period in which the left wing was in the 
presidency of Brazil, the indebtedness  of Petrobras because of poor 
management, politically -driven appointments and f avors and diversion of funds 
reached up to US$170 billion dollars. 
 
   The person who was responsible for all of that was convicted. Whistle -
blowers have returned US$1 billion and we have paid to the US stock market 
another US$ 1 billion due to losses incurred  by shareholders.  
This is Brazil of the past.  
We have upgraded  public  services by reducing costs and investing in 
science and technology. Nowadays, for instance, Brazil is the 7th most digitally 
advanced country in the world: 135 million people access 4,900 services 
provided by my administration. Brazil was a pioneer in the  deployment of 5G in 
Latin America.  
We have implemented a comprehensive agenda of privatizations and 
concessions, with an emphasis on infrastructure. We have concluded the São 
Francisco River transposition project, bringing water to the Brazilian Northeast . 
We have adopted new regulatory frameworks, such as in basic sanitation, 
railroads and natural gas. Moreover, we have improved the business 
environment, with the economic freedom law and the start -up law. As a result, 
we have created opportunities for you ng people to be entrepreneurs and have 
quality jobs.  
Crowning all this effort to modernize the Brazilian economy, we are 
making great strides towards Brazil's entry as a full member of the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD.  
Despite international pressures, Brazil is getting to the end of 2022 with 
an economy in full recovery. We have high employment and low inflation rates. 
The economy is back on the path of growth. Poverty has increased across the 
world under the impact of t he pandemic. In Brazil, it began to fall sharply. 
 
   The figures speak for themselves. It is estimated that, by the end of 2022, 
4% of Brazilian families will be living on less than US$ 1.90 a day. In 2019, it was 
5.1%. This represents a drop of more than 20 %. Auxílio Brasil (Brazil Aid), the 
minimum income program established by my administration during the 
pandemic, pays an amount of  almost US$ 4 a day to the poorest families in our 
country.   
Unemployment fell by 5 percentage points, reaching 9.1%, a rate not seen 
for 7 years. We have reduced inflation, with an estimate of less than 7% annually 
in 2022. I am pleased to announce that we had unprecedented deflation in Brazil 
in the months of July and August. Since June, the price of gasoline has dropped 
by mo re than 30%. Today, a liter of gasoline in Brazil costs about US$ 0.90. The 
price of electricity also fell by more than 15%. Let me stress that the cost of 
energy has not dropped because of price fixing or some other type of state 
intervention. It was the result of a tax rationalization policy formulated and 
implemented with the support of the National Congress.  
In 2021, Brazil was the 4th largest destination for foreign direct investment 
in the world. Our foreign trade reached the historic milestone of 39%  of GDP, 
even after reducing taxes on thousands of products. Domestically, we are also 
record -breakers in three areas: tax collection, state -owned company profits and 
the public debt -to-GDP ratio. In fact, in 2021 we had a surplus in the consolidated 
resul t of national accounts. Brazilian GDP increased by 1.2% in the second 
quarter. The forecast for 2022 is to grow 3%.  
We have the peace of mind of those who are on the right path. The path 
to shared prosperity. Shared among  Brazilians and, beyond that, share d with  our 
neighbors and other partners around the world. 
 
   This is what we see, for example, in food production. Four decades ago, 
Brazil used to import food. Today, we are one of the world's largest exporters. 
This was only possible thanks to heavy invest ments in science and innovation, 
with a view to productivity and sustainability. Here I honor Alysson Paolinelli, 
Brazilian candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize, for his role in expanding the 
Brazilian agricultural frontier with the use of new technologies.  This year, the 
country has already started the largest grain harvest in our history. We estimate 
it to be at least 270 million tons. In a few years, Brazil will also make the transition 
from importer to exporter of wheat.  
For the period 2022/2023, the forecast is that total production will exceed 
300 million tons. As the Director -General of the World Trade Organization stated 
on a recent visit she paid to Brazil, if it weren't for Brazilian agribusiness, the 
planet would go  hungry, as we feed over 1 billion people worldwide.  
Mr. President,  
I also wish to recall that in the area of sustainable development, Brazil's 
achievements are a source of credibility for our country's international action.  
With regard to the environmen t and sustainable development, Brazil is part of 
the solution and a reference to the world.    
Two thirds of the Brazilian territory remain covered by native vegetation, 
which is found exactly as it was when Brazil was discovered in 1500. In the 
Brazilian A mazon, an area equivalent to Western Europe, more than 80% of the 
forest remains untouched, contrary to what is reported by the mainstream 
national and international media.  
It is essential that, when taking care of the environment, we do not 
overlook peop le: the Amazon region is home to more than 20 million 
 
   inhabitants, including indigenous and riverside dwellers, whose livelihood 
depends on some economic use of the forest.  We have brought internet 
connection to more than 11,000 rural schools and to more than 500 indigenous 
communities.  
Brazil began its energy transition almost half a century ago, in reaction to 
the oil crises at that time. Today, we have a modern and sustainable biofuel 
industry. This Industry  contributes to the cleanest energy mix among  the G20 
countries.  
About 84% of our electricity matrix is currently renewable, and this is a 
goal that many developed countries hope to achieve only after 2040 or 2050.  
Last year, Brazil was announced by the United Nations as the “global 
champion for en ergy transition”. We have the potential to become a major 
global exporter of clean energy. We have a surplus, already under construction, 
that can reach more than 100 Gigawatts between biomass, onshore wind and 
solar, in addition to the unexplored opportun ity of 700 Gigawatt offshore wind 
farms, with one of the lowest production costs in the world. These sources will 
produce green hydrogen for export.  
Part of this 100% clean energy opens the possibility for us to become 
suppliers of highly competitive indu strial products, especially in the Brazilian 
Northeast, with one of the smallest carbon footprints in the world.  
The sustainable development agenda is impacted in many ways by threats 
to international peace and security. We built the United Nations from t he ruins 
of the Second World War. What motivated us back then was the determination 
to avoid repeating the cycle of destruction that marked the first half of the 20th 
century. To some extent, we can say that we were successful. 
 
   But today, the conflict in Ukraine serves as a warning. A reform of the UN 
is essential if we are to find world peace. In the specific case of the Security 
Council, after 25 years of debates, it is clear that we need to look for innovative 
solutions.  Brazil delves into this topic b ased on an experience that goes back to 
the beginnings of the UN.  
This is the eleventh time that we have held a non -permanent seat at the 
Council. We have tried to do our best to achieve peaceful and negotiated 
solutions to international conflicts, always  led by the UN Charter and 
International Law.  
Brazil also has an extensive history of participation in UN peacekeeping 
operations.  From Suez to Angola, from Haiti to Lebanon, we have always 
supported the maintenance of peace.  
We have also contributed to peace by opening our borders to those 
seeking a chance to restart their lives in our country Since 2018, over six million 
Venezuelan brothers have been forced to leave their country. Many of them 
came to Brazil. Our response to this challenge was “Operation Welcome”, which 
has become an international benchmark.  More than 350,000 Venezuelans have 
found in Brazilian territory, emergency assistance, protection, documentation 
and the possibility of a fresh start. All of them have access to the labor market, 
to public services and social benefits. In recen t months, around 600 Venezuelans 
have arrived in Brazil every day on foot, the vast majority of whom are women 
and children weighing on average 15 kilos less than before, and who are running 
away from violence and hunger. .  
The Brazilian humanitarian rece ption policy goes beyond Venezuela. We 
have also received Haitians, Syrians, Afghans and Ukrainians. 
 
   Mr. President,  
It has been seven months since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine. It 
is a source of great concern not only in Europe, but throughou t the world.  
First of all, I would like to reiterate Brazil's gratitude to the countries that 
helped with the evacuation of Brazilian citizens who were in Ukraine when the 
conflict started. I refer especially to Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the 
Czech Republic.  The operation was successful. We left no one behind, not even 
their pets.  
With regard to the conflict itself, Brazil has been guided by the principles 
of International Law and the UN Charter. These principles that are also enshrined 
in our Constitution. We defend an immediate ceasefire, the protection of 
civilians and noncombatants, the preservation of critical infrastructure to assist 
the population and the maintenance of all channels of dialogue between the 
parties in conflict. These are t he first steps towards achieving a solution that is 
long -lasting and sustainable.   
We have been working in this sense. At the United Nations and elsewhere, 
we have tried to avoid the hampering of dialogue channels caused by the 
polarization around the con flict.  In this regard, we are against diplomatic and 
economic isolation.  
The fallout of the conflict can already be felt in world prices of foodstuffs, 
fuel and other raw materials. This situation drives us all away from the 
Sustainable Development Goals . Countries that once presented themselves as 
leaders of the low carbon economy have now turned to dirty sources of energy. 
This is a serious setback for the environment. 
 
   We support all efforts to reduce the economic impacts of this crisis. But 
we do not believe that the best way is to adopt unilateral and selective sanctions, 
that are inconsistent with International Law. These measures have harmed the 
economic recovery and threatened human rights of vulnerable populations, 
including in European countries.   
The solution to the conflict in Ukraine will only be achieved through 
negotiation and dialogue.  
I make a plea to the parties, as well as to the entire international 
community: do not miss any opportunity to end the conflict and ensure peace. 
The stabili ty, security and prosperity of humankind are at serious risk if the 
conflict continues or spreads.  
Mr. President,  
I have been an unconditional supporter of freedom of speech. Moreover, 
under my administration, Brazil has made an effort to bring the right to freedom 
of religion to the core of the international human rights agenda. It is essential to 
ensure that everyone has the right to freely worship and practice their religious 
orientation, without discrimination. I would like to inform here that Brazil i s 
ready to welcome the Catholic priests and nuns who have suffered cruel 
persecution by the dictatorial regime in Nicaragua, Brazil repudiates religious 
persecution wherever it occurs in the world.  
Other fundamental values for Brazilian society, with impl ications to the 
human rights agenda, are the defense of the family, the right to life since 
conception, the right to self -defense and the repudiation of gender ideology. 
 
   I would also like to stress the priority we have attached to women's rights. 
Our eff ort to sanction over 70 legal norms on the subject since the beginning of 
my administration, in 2019, is proof of this commitment.  
We fight violence against women very strictly. This is part of our broader 
priority of ensuring public security for all Braz ilians  
The results appear in our government: a 7.7% drop in the number of 
femicides and a decrease in the general number of deaths by homicide. In 2017, 
there were 30 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. Now there are 19.  
Violence in rural areas has also plumm eted at the same time as land 
tenure by the most in need has increased. In my administration, we delivered 
400,000 rural property deeds, 80% of which were given to women.  
We work in Brazil so that we have strong and independent women, so they 
can get wher e they want to be. First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro has brought new 
meaning to volunteer work since 2019, with special attention to people with 
disabilities and rare diseases.  
Mr President, Mr Secretary -General, Heads of State and Government, 
Ladies and Gent lemen,  
This September 7th, Brazil completed 200 years of history as an 
independent nation. Millions of Brazilians took to the streets, wearing the colors 
of their flag.  
It was the largest civic demonstration in the history of our country , a 
people that believes in God, the Nation, the family and freedom.  
Thank you very much.", BRA,2022

77th  Session of the United Nations General Assembly  
Address by H.E. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal,  
Current Chairman of the African Union  
 
*** 
 
Theme  : A watershed moment:  transformative solutions to interlocking challenges  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
New York, 20 September 2022 
 Mr. President of the General Assembly,  
Dear Colleagues,  
Mr. Secretary General  
Distinguished delegates,   
Ladies and Gentlemen , 
 
Mr President, on behalf of the African Union, I would like 
to express my thank s to your predecessor and wish you 
every success in the discharge of your duties.   
I reiterate our support to the Secretary General in 
carrying out his delicate mission in the s ervice of 
Member States.    
Since our last session, the world has become more 
dangerous and uncertain, under  the combined grip of 
global warming, security and health perils, and the war 
in Ukraine.  
The theme of this session reflects the urgent need to act 
together to ease tensions, heal our planet, reduce 
 persistent North -South inequalities, and reinstate the 
importance of multilateralism.   
The Security Council is called upon to address all threats 
to international peace and security, including in Africa, 
in the same way.   
Terrorism, which is gaining ground on the continent, is 
not just an African matter.   
It is a global threat that falls under the primary 
responsibility of the Council, as guaranto r of the 
collective security mechanism, under the Charter of our 
Organization.        
We therefore urge the Council to engage more with us 
in the fight against terrorism in Africa, with more 
appropriate mandates and more substantial resources.   
Furthermor e, the African Union once again calls for the 
lifting of foreign sanctions against Zimbabwe. These 
harsh measures continue to fuel a sense of injustice 
against an entire people, and to aggravate their 
suffering in these times of deep crisis. 
 In the Middl e East, we reiterate the right of the 
Palestinian people to a viable state, living side -by-side in 
peace with the State of Israel, each within secure and 
internationally recognised borders.    
We call for de -escalation and a cessation of hostilities in 
Ukraine, as well as for a negotiated solution, to avoid the 
catastrophic risk of a potentially global conflict.      
 Mr. President,  
Nearly eighty years after the birth of the United Nations 
system and the Bretton Woods Institutions, it is time for 
a fairer, more inclusive global governance, that is more 
adapted to the realities of our time.  
It is time  to  overcome the reluctance and d econstruct 
the narratives that persist in confining Africa to the 
margins of decision -making circles.  
It is time  to do justice to Africa’s just and legitimate 
demand for Security Council reform, as reflected in the 
Ezulwini Consensus. 
 In the same vein, I reaffirm  our request   for the African 
Union to be granted a seat in the G20, so that Africa can 
finally be represented where decisions that affect one 
billion four hundred million Africans are being taken.  
I would like to extend my sinc erest thanks to the 
partners who have already expressed their support and 
invite others to give favourable consideration to our 
candidacy.           
With respect to economic and financial governance, I 
draw the attention of the General Assembly to the 
Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2022, 
produced by some sixty multilateral institutions, 
including the IMF, the World Bank,   the Basel Committee 
on Banking Supervision, the International Association of 
Insurance Regulators and the Financial Stability Board.   
The report highlights shortcomings in the assessment 
processes of credit rating agencies,  and underlines the 
importance of ""transparent methodologies so as not to 
undermine confidence in ratings"". 
 We are concerned that the perception of risk in Africa 
continues to be higher than the actual risk, which 
increases the cost of insurance premiums and 
undermines the competitivene ss of our economies.   
This is why Africa is renewing its proposal to the Global 
Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance to 
engage, in conjunction with the G20, the IMF and the 
World Bank, in a constructive dialogue with the rating 
agencies on im proving their working and assessment 
methods.  
In the same spirit, in view of the unprecedented scale of 
the global economic crisis, the African Union reiterates 
its call for the partial reallocation of Special Drawing 
Rights and the implementation of the G 20 Debt Service 
Suspension Initiative.  
This unprecedented shock further destabilises the 
weakest economies and makes their need for liquidity 
even more pressing, to mitigate the effects of 
 widespread inflation and to support the most vulnerable 
households and social strata, especially young people 
and women.  
In addition, there is the need to address new and old 
health emergencies, including cancer, a silent killer that 
continues to claim millions of lives across the world.   
I call for a general mobilisation in favour of the IAEA's 
Rays of Hope  campaign to strengthen the capacities of 
member countries, particularly in Africa, in the fight 
against cancer, using nuclear technologies such as 
medical imaging, nuclear medicine and radiotherapy.   
 
 
Mr. President ,          
With the COP -27 in Sharm El Sheikh only a few weeks 
away, Africa reiterates its commitment to the Paris 
Climate Agreement. 
 At the same time, we wish to reach a consensus for a fair 
and equitable energy transition, as was called for at the 
Africa -Europe Summit last February, at the enlarged 
session of the G7 Summit in June, and recently at the 
Africa Adaptation Finance Forum in  Rotterdam.  
It is legitimate, fair and equitable that Africa, the 
continent that pollutes the least and lags furthest 
behind in the industrialisation process, should exploit its 
available resources to provide basic energy, improve the 
competitiveness of its economy an d achieve universal 
access to electricity.   
I will recall that today more than 600 million Africans 
still live without electricity.   
Let us also work towards the goal of mobilizing USD 100 
billion per year to support developing countries' 
adaptation effo rts and to finance the African Adaptation 
Acceleration Program under the auspices of the AfDB 
and the Global Centre for Adaptation. 
 Moreover, we see adaptation funding not as aid, but as 
a contribution by industrialised countries to a global 
partnership of solidarity , in return for efforts by 
developing countries to avoid the polluting patterns that 
have plunged the planet into the current climate 
emergency.   
 Mr. President,  
Over and above current emergencies, I have come to 
convey the message of a cont inent determined to work 
with all its partners in a relational ethic of trusting 
dialogue and mutual respect.     
I have come to say that Africa has suffered enough of 
the burden of history; that it does not want to be the 
breeding ground of a new cold war , but rather a pole of 
stability and opportunity open to all its partners, on a 
mutually beneficial basis. 
 I have come to  say that we do not ignore that Africa, 
faced with challenges , needs to be pacified and 
stabilised.  
But I have also come to say  that we also have  Africa as 
a provider of solutions , with an area 30 million km2, its 
human resources, more than 60% of the world's arable 
land, its mineral, forest, water and energy resources.  
Yes, we have the Africa of solutions , with governments 
on th e job; vibrant and creative youth who innovate, 
undertake and succeed; millions of men and women 
who work hard to feed, educate and care for their 
families; who invest, create wealth and generate jobs.   
This Africa of solutions wants to engage with all it s 
partners in a reinvented relationship that transcends the 
prejudice that whoever is not with me is against me . 
We want a multilateralism that is open and respectful of 
our differences; because the United Nations system, 
born out of the ashes of war, can only win the support 
 of all on the basis of shared ideals, not local values 
erected as universal norms.  
It is by working together, respecting our differences, 
that we will restore the strength and vitality of the 
United Nations' raison d'être: to save pres ent and future 
generations from the scourge of war, to advance the 
peaceful coexistence of peoples, and to foster progress 
by creating better living conditions for all.   
I wish the 77th Session of the General Assembly every 
success.   
Thank you.", SEN,2022

REMARKS BY  
HIS MAJESTY KING ABDULLAH II 
AT THE 77TH PLENARY SESSION OF THE  
UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
NEW YORK 
20 SEPTEMBER 2022  
 
In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
 
Mr President,  
Mr Secretary General,  
Your Excellencies:  
 
We meet today,  in this General Assembly , as the alarm bells ring all 
around us.  Numerous  crises batter our world ; crises that are increasingly 
interlocked —regional conflicts  with international impact , devastating climate 
change , pandemic disruptions , extremist violence , spiralling inflation , 
looming recession , and—for all too many around the world —the growing 
reality of hunger. Developing countries have been hit hardest of all.  
 
Is this the future we will leave to the generations  yet to come?  
 
We must deliver a different world —a world of expanded horizons , a 
more equitable world , sustainable economic growth,  exciting new 
opportunities , more and better jobs , and the inclusive peace for prosperity, in 
which all people can thrive.  
 
To reach these goals, our countries must unite behind effective, 
collaborat ive action. The question now is  will we have the vision and 
determination to get the job done?  
 
Consider the climate crisis. No country can heal our injured earth alone. 
We need global partnerships that can create real change. And Jordan is part of 
these efforts. We have been building strong partnerships to manage and 
sustain vital water resources . And we see more opportunities to work with 
partners to preserve precious worl d heritage sites  and natural wonders —the 
unique Dead Sea, the sacred Jordan River , and the resilient  coral reefs  of the 
Gulf of Aqaba —which are all threatened by climate change.  
 
Food security is another global priority . Hundreds of millions of people 
go to bed hungry, and the numbers are rising . How can parents raise healthyPage  2 of 4 
children ? How can students learn ? How can workers do their best, when they 
are hungry and hopeless?  
 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, and now with the crisis in 
Ukraine, global supply chains have been disrupted. Many well -off countries 
experienced empty food shelves for the first time in living memory. They are 
discovering a truth that people in developing countries have known for a long 
time—for countries to thri ve, affordable food must get to every family's table.  
On a global level, this demands collective measures  to ensure fair access to 
affordable food, and speed the movement of staples to countries in need.  
 
My friends,  
 
Sustainable, inclusive economic growth  has too often been a victim of 
global crises , but it can also be a defence that strengthens us to endure the 
storms. In my region, we are looking to build integrated partnerships that tap 
the capabilities and resources of each of our countries for the ben efit of all.  
 
We see 'regional resilience packs' coming together to stimulate fresh 
opportunities and growth. Jordan has established multilateral partnerships 
with Egypt, Iraq, the UAE, Saudi Arabia,  Bahrain,  and others in the region to 
capitalise on these opportunities. Our country is a bridge for regional 
partnership s and cooperation , international crisis response , and humanitarian 
action.  
 
Jordan has always been a source of regional stability, as well as a refuge 
for those in need.  In this context, let me say a word about refugees and the 
communities which host them. In 2012, I came before the 67th General 
Assembly, and spoke for the first time about the Syrian refugee flow and its 
pressure on Jordan's scarc e resources. At that point, 200,000  Syrians had 
sought refuge in our small country. Today, 10 years later,  we host more than 
1.3 million.  
 
Meeting the needs of these and other refugees is an international 
responsibility, and host countries look to the inte rnational community to 
honour its commitments . 
 
My friends,Page  3 of 4 
For decades, the Middle East has been synonymous with conflict and 
crisis. But we are hopeful that a new -found spirit of collaboration can make 
our region an exemplar of resilience and integration.  
 
Though politics may sometimes fail our world , one absolute remains —
always put people first. To keep hope alive for all peoples  means  rising above 
politics to ensure every individual’s prosperity.  Such efforts will be fruitless 
if they are exclusionary. Inclusion of the Palestinian people in regional 
economic projects  should be  an integral part of our e fforts.  
 
In the Palestinian -Israeli confl ict, p eace continues to be elusive . Neither 
war nor diplomacy ha s held the answer to this historic tragedy . 
 
It is the people themselves, not politics and politicians, who will have 
to come together and push their leaders to resolve this.  
 
What would our world look like now if the conflict had been settled 
long ago? If walls had never gone up, and people had been allowed to build 
bridges of cooperation instead? What if extremists had never been able to 
exploit the injustices of occupation? How many generations of youth could 
have grown up in the o ptimism of peace and progress?  
 
As we continue our efforts to achieve peace, we must not abandon 
refugees. This year, the General Assembly will vote on renewing UNRWA’s 
mandate. The international community should send a strong message of 
support for the rights of Palestinian r efugees,  ensuring that Palestinian refugee 
children have schools to go to, and acce ss to appropriate medical care.  
 
My dear friends,  
 
A founding UN principle is the right to self -determination for all 
peoples . The Palestinian people, with their resilient national identity, cannot 
be denied this right. And the road forward is  the two -state solution, in 
accordance with UN resolutions —a sovereign, viable, and independent 
Palestinian state, on the 4th of June 1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its 
capital, living side -by-side with Israel in peace , security , and prosperity . 
 
Today, t he future  of Jerusalem is a n urgent  concern. The city is holy to 
billions of Muslims, Christians, and Jews around the world. Undermining 
Jerusalem’s legal and historical status quo triggers global tensions  andPage  4 of 4

division . 
 
As Custodian s of Jerusalem's Muslim and Christian Holy Sites, we are

ADDRESS TO THE 77TH SESSION OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY   
by  
PRESIDENT of the REPUBLIC of TÜRKİYE, H.E. RECEP 
TAYYİP ERDOĞAN  
(20 SEPTEMBER 2022, NEW YORK)  
 
Esteemed President,  
Distinguished Heads of State and Government,  
Honourable Secretary General,  
Dear delegates,  
On behalf of myself, and my n ation, I greet you with my most heartfelt 
feelings and respect.  
I wish the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly to be 
beneficial to our countries and to all humanity.  
I would like to cong ratulate Mr. C saba  KÖRÖSİ, who assumed the duty of 
President of the General Assembly.  
I find the theme , ""A watershed moment: transformative solutions to 
interlocking challenges"" , set for our General Assembly meeting , very 
fitting , as we are holding our meeting at a critical time when our world is 
trying to deal with multiple threats simultaneously.  
The primary  lesson we learned  in the fight against the coronavirus 
pandemic was the importance of international solidarity in solving global 
problems.  
We provided support to 161 countries and 12 international organizations , 
without any distinction , during the pandemic. 
 We put our domestic and national vaccine, TURKOVAC, into the service 
of all humanity.  
As an indication of the importance we attach  to the  fight against climate 
change, w e ratified the Paris Agreement last year.  
In our national statement, we declared our net zero emissions target for 
2053 and our Green Development Revolution.  
By hosting the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to th e United 
Nations Convention on Biological Diversity , we will continue to play a 
pioneering role also in this field . 
We observe  that the global economy, which has been hit hard by 
disruptions in the supply chains caused by the pandemic, is facing yet 
another  new shock wave due to the  Russia -Ukraine war.  
The i nflation ist pressure , triggered by the rising energy, food and raw 
material prices , negatively affects all economies and social welfare on a 
global scale . 
Developments have brought to the fore , once again , in a striking way, the 
importance of energy supply security.  
As Türkiye, we have considered from the outset the issue of energy as an 
area of cooperation, not competition.  
In addition to our own needs, we have implemented many projects that 
support regional and global energy security.  
The accuracy  and the importance of these steps have  been understood 
once again , with the latest developments . 
The ongoing process has also jeopardized food s ecurity . 
In the 21st century , when material and technological means  have reached 
the highest level, it is impossible to explain  why one fifth of the world's 
population is still suffering from hunger and poverty.  
With the latest developments, the world is also deviating from the 
sustainable development goals  towards ""zero hunger"" in 2030.  
The only way to shed a light of hope on this grim picture humanity is facing , 
is to strengthen international cooperation and solidarity through a fair and 
just approach. 
 We have entered a n era where we need to take action through  a common 
agenda against the challenges affecting our common destiny.  
As Türkiye, we are display ing our will also in tackling  the shocks caused 
by the Russia -Ukraine war, a longside  the pandemic and climate change 
processes.  
Since the first day of the conflict in Ukraine, which has now completed its 
seventh month, we have acted with the understanding  that ""war has no 
winners,  a just peace has no losers "".  
Today, we still keep emphasiz ing the key role of dialogue and diplomacy 
in resolving th e current  crisis.  
 
Through the facilitat ing role we have assumed  with this understanding , we 
brought the Parties together , first at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum , and 
then in Istanbul.  
 
As a result of t he intensive efforts we carried out together with the 
Secretary General, we made sure  that the Ukrainian grain was able to 
reach the world through the Black Sea.  
 
Now that almost two months have gone by after the Istanbul Memorandum 
of Understanding which enabled this achievement, w e are pleased to note 
that these shipment s gain momentum day by day .  
 
This memorandum, which bears  critical importance in ensuring  the 
sustainability of grain supply, is one of the greatest achievements of the 
United Nations in recent years.  
 
Trust  in the United Nations by those around the world who seek help from 
the international community has been re invigorated , thanks to  this 
achievement.  
 
The Istanbul Memorandum of Understanding  has also proved that 
negotiations do yield results on issues which are of vital importance to the 
parties.  
 
A similar approach can also be displayed  regarding the crisis at the 
Zaporizhzhia  Nuclear Power Station , which concerns the safety of the 
entire  humanity. 
 We will continue to increase our efforts to end the war, which has been 
reignited in recent days , based on  the territorial integrity and 
independence of Ukraine.  
 
I hereby call upon  international organizations and all countries to provide 
genuine support  to Türkiye's efforts to wards  establish ing a lasting peace.  
 
We need to find  together  a reasonable, just and viable diplomatic solution 
that will provide both sides the opportunity of an “hono urable exit” . 
 
On the other hand, all these disasters which have caus ed grievance to 
millions of people , have once again reminded all of us our responsibility to 
display further efforts towards the embodiment of an effective 
multilateralism by the United Nations.  
 
It is imperative that we  restructure  the United Nations as an organization 
worthy of its inclusive character, capable of producing solutions for a fairer 
world order, and in which a common will is displayed  on behalf of the entire 
humanity.  
 
In particular, enabling  the Security Council with a more effective, 
democratic, transparent and accountable structure and functioning will be 
an important milestone  in the pursuit of peace, justice and welfare of the 
entire  humanity.  
 
To keep reminding our common duty towards that end , we will continue to  
underline that "" THE WORLD IS BIGGER THAN FIVE"" and ""A FAIRER 
WORLD IS POSSIBLE"" , on every platform, and in the strongest terms  
possible.  
 
I would like to state once again that we expect support from all member 
states  in this struggle we conduct  with faith and determination.  
 
 
Distinguished delegates , 
 
The vision  of Türkiye  in foreign policy has always been focused on peace.  
 
We are working hard to make sure that peace prevail s, first in our region , 
but also all over the world. 
 We strive to resolve conflicts with our “Mediation for Peace” initiative, 
which we pursue  within the United Nations.  
 
We take on a constructive role, sometimes as a mediator and sometimes 
as a facilitator, in resolving conflicts breaking out in different r egions , from 
Europe to Latin America , and to Africa.  
 
As a country situated  at the very heart of  a region surrounded by conflicts  
and disputes, we under take initiatives t hat enable us to be  a part of the 
solution, rather than the problem.  
 
In this context, we reiterate the importance of finding a permanent solution 
to the Syrian crisis, based on Security Council Resolution 2254 , in line with 
the legitimate expectations of the Syrian people.  
The ongoing deadlock increasingly threatens both the security and stability 
of our region and the territorial integrity of Syria.  
More than four million civilians in the northwest  of Syria are clinging on to 
life thanks to the security umbrella provided by our country and through 
international aid.  
The Security Council must fulfil its responsibility to extend the mandate , 
which forms the basis of the UN cross -border humanitarian aid mechanism  
to the northwest of Syria.  
No one can expect Türkiye to remain indifferent to the PKK and its 
affiliates, which perpetrate terrorist attacks against our country, our 
security forces and civilians, and pose a threat to Syria's territorial integrity 
with their separatist agenda.  
We call on those trying to legitimize this terrorist organization with cheap 
tricks , such as changing its name, to stop arming and supporting terrorists 
without delay, and  to reverse their wrong course . 
We strongly reiterate that it is within our power to take all kinds of 
measures against terrorism and that we will never hesitate to do what is 
necessary against terrorist organizations.  
We sincerely fulfil our part to create the necessary conditions for our 
Syrian brothers and sisters to return to their countr y voluntarily, safely and 
with dignity. 
 We are building 10 0.000  brick shelters  in various regions of Syria , so that 
the civilians which have fled the war can live in adequate humanitarian 
conditions.  
We have completed and handed over a n important part  of these shelters .  
Besides, we have started preparations to construct 200 .000 houses that 
will enable approximately one million Syrians to return to their lands.  
The support of  the international community  is needed  to realize this 
project, which will include construction in 13 separate safe centres and  in 
their rural areas.  
We expect all parties to make the necessary effort s and to show solidarity 
with the settlement project  that we will implement in Syria.  
The refugee crisis cannot be solved by sinking the boats of innocents who 
set out to seek a better future, thus leaving them to die, and by building 
walls on borders, and filling concentration camps with people.  
The soluti on to this crisis lies only in efforts centered on human life . 
And yet, we see that Greece is increasing the extent  of cruelty against 
immigrants in the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean.  
While we struggle to prevent other babies, like Aylan, from washing up on 
the shores, Greece is turning the Aegean Sea into a graveyard for 
refugees with its unlawful and reckless pushbacks.  
Last week, baby Asım,  9 months old , and Abdulvahap,  4 years old,  died 
with their families because the Greek coast guards sank their boats.  
It is high time for Europe and the institutions of the United Nations to  say 
“stop” to these acts without mercy that constitute crime s against humanity.  
We are making every effort to ensure t hat peace and stability prevail in 
another neighbouring country of ours, Iraq.  
We want the political unity and reconciliation to be  achieved  in th at 
country , on the basis of the Iraqi identity.  
This is the only way to promote welfare in a sustainable manner  in Iraq 
and to prevent abuses by terrorist organizations. 
 Meanwhile, of course we will never allow terrorist organizations, which 
exploit  the unstable environment in Iraq,  to carry out actions  targeting our 
country.  
 
As I have repeatedly emphasized on this p odium , we can win the fight 
against  the scourge of  terrorism through sincere  and effective international 
cooperation that rejects any distinction  between terrorist organizations.  
 
Türkiye, which has been fighting  for many years all terrorist organizations , 
regardless of the name under which they operate , has the natural right to 
expect a sincere cooperation  and solidarity  from its allies and friends on 
this issue.  
 
We are ready to work with everyone willing to cont ribute to the security, 
stability, peace and prosperity of the region by cooperating with our 
country , rather than with terrorist organizations and cruel regimes.  
 
 
Distinguished delegates,  
 
North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean are other regions that we 
need to carefully focus on, as far as  security in the world  is concerned . 
 
Within  this framework, Libya’s stability and prosperity are of crucial 
importance for the whole region, and primarily  for its neighbours.  
 
Türkiye supports the efforts of the United Nations in this direction.  
 
Our goal is to enable Libya to reach the prosperity level it deserves, by 
protecting the sovereignty, unity , and integrity of the Libyan people.  
 
The main goal to which all of us should contribute to , must  be fair and 
credible  election s in Libya , through which  a strong government , taking its 
legitimacy from the people , will come to power . 
 
With regard to the Israel -Palestine conflict , which we deem  necessary to 
end for the establishment of a lasting peace and stability in the Middle 
East, we strongly support the vision  of a two-state solution.  
 
It is essential  to respect the historical and cultural identity of Jerusalem 
and the sanctity  of al -Haram al -Sharif, to stop the illegal settlemen t 
 activities  on the territories under occupation and to ensure the safety of 
the Palestinians’ lives and property.  
 
For a just, lasting, and comprehensive resolution to the dispute in the 
region, there is no other possibility , except for the establishment of an 
independent and sovereign Palestin ian State , with East Jerusalem  as its 
capital . 
 
As Türkiye , we are  determined to  continue  to develop  our relations with 
Israel for the sake of the future, peace  and stability of not only the region , 
but also of Israel, the Palestinian people , and that of ours. 
 
During this process , it is the international community’s responsibility to 
improve the institutional and financial capacity of the United Nations Relief 
and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East , and t o protect 
the oppressed Palestinians.  
 
Türkiye is a country which  has always emphasized the importance the 
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action  with Iran bears  for global and regional 
stability.  
 
We expect that the negotiations for the resolution , through diplomacy and 
dialogue, of the issues regarding  Iran’s nuclear program , will be concluded 
and implemented  as soon as possible . 
 
The liberation by Azerbaijan  of its occupied territories has  offered  a historic  
window of opportunity for a permanent peace and stability in the South 
Caucasus.  
 
Türkiye has taken very important steps  to make good use of  this 
opportunity,  by supporting the processes  between  Azerbaijan and 
Armenia.  
Although the clashes in recent days  have cast a shadow on  this positive  
environment , we believe that it is still possible to sign a comprehensive 
peace agreement between the two countries in the  short est time possible . 
We will always continue to stand by our Azerbaijani brothers in their 
struggle to preserve  their rights and build their future. 
 The opening, without delay, of  the transportation  routes  in the regi on, 
which is an issue that also concerns our country closely, will contribute  to 
the welfare of all. 
Afghanistan,  which is struggling with problems such as occupation, armed 
conflicts , terrorism,  and misery for almost half a century, is again going 
through a challenge.  
The steps to be taken by the Interim Government  in the country  to protect 
fundamental human rights , may pave the way for promising developments.  
Türkiye  will continue support ing its Afghan brothers and sisters in these 
difficult times . 
We regret that  a strong peace , and cooperation between India and 
Pakistan  has still not yet been established, despite 75 years following their 
independenc e. 
We hope that a just and lasting peace , and tranquillity  will be  reached in 
Kashmir.  
We once again convey our recovery  wishes to the  Pakistan i people , who 
are going through extremely difficult times , due to the recent flood disaster.  
We continue  our humanitarian aid work , which we have initiated following 
the disaster, without interruption .  
We also expect the international community to support the Pakistan i 
people  during  this painful period that they are going through.  
We continue to support the safe, voluntary, dignified,  and permanent 
return of the Rohingya Muslims to their homeland.  
We are sensitive to the protecti on of the  fundamental rights and freedoms 
of the Muslim Uyghur Turks,  in a way  without any detriment at all to One 
China policy  and China's territorial integrity  and sovereign rights .  
We continue  our intens ive efforts , both  on bilateral and multilateral 
platforms , to strengthen peace and stability  in the  Balkans and to solve 
disagreements  by way of  dialogue.  
With this understanding,  we visited the region at the beginning of 
September, covering Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia , and Croatia. 
 The holding of problem -free elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina , and 
progress  in the Belgrade -Pristina Dialogue Process will contribute to the 
stability of the region.  
As T ürkiye , we want all the issues  in the Aegean Sea and  the Eastern 
Mediterranean to be solved within the framework of good neighbourly  
relations and in conformity  with international law.  
Those who pursue a show of force  in the region , despite the ir political and 
military levels  that are in no way  on a par with our country, make 
themselves look nonsensical . 
 
The continuatio n of peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean 
depends on respecting the rights of all the parties.  
 
We expect Greece to put aside the politics of tension and provocation , and 
to heed our calls for cooperation and solidarity.  
 
We believe that  the Eastern Mediterranean Conference we have 
previously proposed will serve this purpose.  
 
The fact that our counterparts  have not even made the slightest effort on 
this issue so far  shows who is in favour  of peace and dialogue and who is 
in favour  of tension.  
 
While Türkiye will defend its rights in  the Aegean and the Eastern 
Mediterranean until the end, it will never fall into the trap of those who 
follow a strategy of tension for  the sake of  their own political purposes.  
Together with the Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus, we have always 
shown goodwill and  have displayed constructive efforts to reach a just, 
lasting and sustainable settlement to the Cyprus issue.   
In fact, anyone who is willing to see the truth is aware that there are two 
distinct states and two distinct peoples  on the Island today.  
The re affirmation  of the rights of equal sovereignty and equal international 
status of the Turkish Cypriot people  is the key to a settlement on the Island.  
We hereby call on the international community to put an end to the  
oppression towards the Turkish Cypriot s and to the efforts to isolate them  
from the world  through embargoes , contrary to the principles of the United 
 Nations, and to officially recognize the Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cypru s as soon as possible . 
In addition to its inhumane pushbacks of irregular migrants in the Aegean 
Sea, Greece, a member of the European Union, has been pursuing 
discriminatory and oppressive policies against the Turkish Muslim 
Minority , in violation of its legal obligations.  
We hope that Greece will bring an end to all these wrongful practices and 
that the international organizations, starting with  the European Union, will 
stop turning a blind eye to these inhumane and unlawful actions .  
 
Distinguished delegates,   
The value of T ürkiye 's cooperation with the European Union becomes 
evident again , any time a  new challenge arises on the global and regional 
stage.  
As a strong Ally marking this year our  70th membership anniversary in 
NATO, we have been contributing to the security of the Euro -Atlantic 
region, both through our diplomatic actions and military capabilities.  
While w e continue to contribute to the security, stability and prosperity of 
the European continent with our European  identity , as the westernmost 
Asian, we also pursue the same objective in th e Asian  continent, through 
the ""Asia Anew"" initiative.  
We are also taking one step after another to strengthen our solidarity with 
the African countries, which recently are facing  in an increasing  manner  
the severe repercussions of the global problems.  
In this context, we held the Third T ürkiye -Africa Partnership Summit , which 
was widely attended by our African friends , between  16 and 18 December  
2021 .  
Türkiye  demonstrates on all occasions , as an equal partner , its will to 
contribute to the African continent's path to wards  peace, development and 
prosperity.  
We are also determined to continue enhancing our cooperation with Latin 
America, which has already been strengthened based on  mutual respect, 
both on a bilateral level , and at the institutional level  in regional 
organisations . 
 We believe that one of the biggest threa ts awaiting  humanity  in this era, 
as the international system is shaken by various crises , is the loss of the 
will to ""live together"".  
We are deeply concerned by the rise of racism, discrimination, 
xenophobia,  and hatred against Islam  in recent years.  
From this podium, we had called for the  15th of March, the date at which 
the terrorist attack against Muslims in New Zealand  took place , to be 
declared as the ""International Day to Combat Islamophobia"".  
Our call was put into action through  the resolutions adopted initially at the 
Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , and then at the United Nations 
General Assembly.  
We wholeheartedly hope that this approach, which we regard as a sign of 
the international community's determination in combating  hatred against 
Islam , will be put into practice .  
As I have emphasized many times before, we consider hatred against 
Islam as a crime against  humanity, just like antisemitism.  
With these views, I wish that the 77th session of the United Nations 
General Assembly  be productive so that it achieves  the success which will 
fulfil the hopes and expectations of humanity.  
I once again would like to salute  you all with appreciation  and respect on 
behalf of my nation.  
May you all remain in good health…", TUR,2022

Address by the Presiden t of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Zhaparov at 
the General Debates of the 77th Session of the General Assembly of the 
United Nations  
(September 20, 2022, New York City)  
 
Dear Mr President  
 Distingui shed heads of delegations  
 Dear Secretary General  
  
I would like to sincerely congratulate the brother ly Hungary  on the 
election of its high representative as the President  of the S eventy -Seventh 
Session of the United Nations General Assembly.  
 I wish the honorable Mr. Chaba Kyoroshi every success in such an 
important international position.  
You can always count on full support of the Kyrgyz Republic . 
At the same time, I would like to thank Mr. Abdullah Shahid, the 
President of the previous session of the UN General Assembly, for his hard 
work during the difficult times for the world community, as well as for 
supporting the international initiatives of our country.  
 
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
The United Nations was established 77 years ago after the worst world 
war in the history of the  mankind.  
Perhaps the founding states of the UN, who signed the international 
agreement to establish the organization in San Francisco in 1945, naively 
believed that wars, destruction, hunger, and suffering would end forever?  
I don't think so.  
Success can always be achieved if there is a mutual understanding that 
disputes and disagreements must be resolved in a spirit of good faith and 
compromise. In the history of UN, t here have been many important victories and 
successes.  
Although conflicts o ccur with varying degrees of severity in different 
regions of the world, the UN has played an important unifying role a s moral 
authority in maintaining peace and security, and providing for people's needs 
and wants.  
Now, in the conditions of an unprecedented complication of the 
geopolitical situation in the world, which has created alarming expectations 
in the international community due to the threat of the destruction of the 
fundamental foundations of peaceful coexistence and the inevitability of a 
major war, it is important for all of us to remember the high goals and 
objectives that were fixed in the UN Charter, namely:  “To maintain 
international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective 
measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the 
suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring 
about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and 
international law, adjustment or settlement of interna tional disputes or 
situations which might lead to a breach of the peace; to develop friendly 
relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and 
self-determination of peoples”.   
Ever since our country became a state, we have consistently and 
strictly followed the UN Charter and have been fulfilling our duties in good 
faith.  
This March marked exactly thirty years since our country joined the 
United Nations, and recently, on August 31, we celebrated the thirty -first 
anniversary of the independence of the Kyrgyz Republic.  
We always strive to “resolve our international disputes by peaceful 
means ”. 
In international relations , we always refrain “from the threat or use of 
force as against the territorial integrity or political independence of any 
state…”.  
Looking back at the thorny path passed by our country, we highly  
appreciate the multifaceted contribution of the UN to the formation of 
Kyrgyzstan as an independent and sovereign state, an equal and responsible 
member  of the international community.  
Our people will never forget the support and assistance of the UN 
family in the formation of political, public and civil institutions, the 
strengthening of democracy, and the development of a market economy.  
On behalf of our generous people and on my own behalf, I express my 
gratitude to all the leaders and staff of the UN system, who sincerely and selflessly helped us to realize the centuries -old dream of the Kyrgyz people 
to create their own independent stat e. Thank you very much!   
  
Dear Mr President,  
 
Taking this opportunity, I would like to present to the world 
community from this high podium  the actual situation that is developing on 
the southern borders of our country, taking into account the latest events 
related to the another aggravation of the situation on the Kyrgyz -Tajik 
border.  
First, let me briefly touch on the history.  
The collapse  of the Soviet Union in December 1991 paved a way for 
territorial disputes and border problems . 
Some of them have not been regulated to this day . 
If there were more than twenty disputed areas along the entire 
perimeter of the Soviet -Chinese border, five of them  were  in Kyrgyzstan.  
I want to proudly remind the world community that we have 
successfully completed issues of border regulation, first with the People's 
Republic of China in 1996 and jointly with the Republic of Kazakhstan at 
the point of intersection of the state borders of the three countries in 1999; 
then with the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2017.  
We have now practically completed our joint work and are about to 
sign the Agreement on the State Border with the Republic of Uzbekistan.  
I am p leased to note that the state borders with these three neighboring 
countries have become the borders of peace, good neighborliness, friendship 
and mutually beneficial cooperation.  
With regard to relations with the Republic of Tajikistan, I would like 
to no te the following.  
Our two close neighboring peoples have been living side by side  for a 
long time.  
We are united by common values, culture, traditions and customs, we 
share the same faith . 
Our peoples are intertwined by family ties.  
Our legendary father  Manas was married to the Tajik princess 
Kanykey.  
I would like to also remind that legally the collapse of the Soviet Union 
occurred on December 21, 1991 in the city of Alma -Ata of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, when the heads of 11 newly i ndependent states adopted the Alma -Ata Declaration  “On the Creation of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States ”. 
The Declaration stated that independent states recognize and respect 
each other's territorial integrity and the inviolability of existing border s. 
They indicate  that “the strengthening of relations of friendship, good 
neighborliness and mutually beneficial cooperation, which have deep 
historical roots, meets the fundamental interests of the people and serve the 
cause of peace and security. ” 
It is written that the countries feel their “responsibility to maintain civil 
peace and international harmony ”. 
This legal  document was signed by all the 11 P residents of the member 
states to the Commonwealth of Independent States , including the Republic 
of Tajikistan.  
This principle was confirmed by the President of Tajikistan Emomali 
Rahmon  in the Moscow Declaration of the CIS “On respect for sovereignty, 
territorial integrity and immunity of borders of the State Parties of the 
Com monwealth of Independent States”  dated April 15, 1994.  
He signed and agreed.  
It is a pity that he is deviating from the principle now.  
He made his first official visit to the Kyrgyz Republic in 1998 after 
the end of the bloody civil war in Tajikistan.  
Later, two bilateral interstate agreements were concluded between the 
Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic of Tajikistan:  the Agreement on the Basic 
Interstate Relations of July 12, 1996 and the Agreement on Good Neighborly 
and Partnership Relation s of May 26, 2004.  
I want to note that both agreements were signed in Dushanbe . 
From the very beginning of work on the settlement of border issues 
between our two states, the Kyrgyz side has always acted in full compliance 
with its international obligations, including bilateral ones, conducted 
negotiations in a constructive manner, offering mutually beneficial 
compromises.  
I would like to note that in April 2021, the armed forces of Tajikistan 
launched an unjustified unprovoked large -scale aggression on our territory, 
killing 36 citizens and caused serious material damage.  
Although my decision to meet the President of the Republic of 
Tajikistan in Dushanbe was heavily criticized by the Kyrgyz people (who 
demanded that I meet in a neutral location), none the less I flew to D ushanbe  
and met with the President Rahmon in June last year to try and find a 
mutually beneficial solution s to the border issues . For the sake of my people, I am ready to spend not only ten hours on 
negotiations, as on that day, but to spend as much time as possible to solve 
this issue once and for all.  
Of course, whatever the solution is, it should be mutually beneficial.  
It is all the more painful for me to report that on September 14, 15 and 
16 of this year, large -scale military clashes took place in the south of 
Kyrgyzstan.  
Despite all previously nego tiated agreements, the Ta jik side  attacked 
border and civilian objects along the entire perimeter of the Kyrgyz -Tajik 
state border.  
About 140,000 of our civilians have been evacuated from border 
settlements. They are being provided with the necessary assis tance.  
In this regard, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the UN 
system, our friends and partners for their solidarity and support.  
Great material damage was caused to civilian and military facilities: 
houses, administrative buildings, schools, frontier posts.  
Any material damage can be restored . 
However, you cannot return the lives of our citizens who were fired 
upon and brave defenders who died fighting for the ir homeland  and 
sacrific ed their lives.  
We will never forget the bravery of our courageous  soldiers.  
We are deeply saddened by the unjustified armed aggressions by 
Tajikistan, even though there are international agreements and obligations 
that have been established between our countries.  
Pacta s unt servanda, Latin for “agreements must be kept”  
We are ready to continue in any format the negotiation process with 
our Tajik neighbors  based on international rules and civilized legal ways . 
Taking into account that our trust has been weakened by the recent 
lawless actions of our neighbor, we are ready to continue negotiations and 
welcome mediation efforts by international organizations, including the UN, 
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the Collect ive 
Security Treaty Organization . 
We have documented evidence of the previous year’s and yesterday’s 
illegal and ill -intentioned actions of the Tajik side.  
We are never the first to start and never will.  
We a lways tr y to avoid using weapons, and even more so, never sh oot 
at unarmed civilians!  
We are always forced to adequately respond to the aggression of the 
Tajik side.  
In this regard, I would like to emphasize the following: the Kyrgyz 
side does not claim foreign lands, nor does it intend to give a centimeter of 
its land to anyone. We are convinced that all border and internal  issues should be resolved 
over the negotiation table , and there is such will and readiness on our part.  
The most important issue today is the adoption of urgent measures to 
ensure security and stability in the border areas, stop any actions aimed at 
increasing tension s among the local population, and strengthen the trust 
between our two states.   
We are always ready for negotiations and clarification of our borders.  
  
Dear Mr President,  
 
Regarding the general UN issues , I would like to note the following.  
This year as h alf of the implementation period of the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals until 2030 has passed and we can  now objectively look 
at the real situation  at hand . 
The adoption of the SDGs in 2015 under the motto “Leave no one 
behind ” was a bright  example of the constructive negotiation capacity of the 
world community in the interests of all of us and subsequent genera tions.  
Meanwhile, it has already become obvious that due to objective 
circumstances, including due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 
implementation  of the sustainable development  goals  in developing 
countries, including our country, has slowed down, and wit hout adequate 
international funding, many of them may not even achieve the critical 
indicators of the sustainable development  goals .  
On my part, I want to confirm the firm commitment of the Kyrgyz 
Republic to the SDGs and their gradual implementation, tak ing into account 
national capacity . 
I believe that our country's own potential should be the main source 
and engine of sustainable development.  
For these purposes, our efforts are aimed at achieving an accelerated 
and qualitative growth of the economy , including through mutually 
beneficial regional and international trade and investment cooperation.  
For example, Kyrgyzstan actively participates in integration and 
cooperation processes, including the Eurasian Economic Union and the “One 
Belt - One Road ” initiative of the People's Republic of China.  
On my part, I want to confirm the firm commitment of the Kyrgyz

For example, Kyrgyzstan actively participates in integration and 
coopera tion processes, including the Eurasian Economic Union and the “One 
Belt - One Road ” initiative of the People's Republic of China.  
As part of the ongoing policy, priority is given to the development of 
a “green ”, “digital ” and “creative ” economy.  
The countr y is actively developing the locomotive of the “green 
economy ”: hydropower industry; small and medium -sized hydropower 
plants are being put into operation.   
Our esteemed neighbors - Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan - will 
participate in the construction of the largest hydroelectric power station - 
Kambarata, because this will strengthen theenergy security and optimize the 
use of water resources in the region.  
In gene ral, I want to note the spirit of unity, mutual understanding, 
trust and support, which was demonstrated in the city of Cholpon -Ata two 
months ago, when the Fourth Consultative Meeting of the Heads of State of 
Central Asia was held under the chairmanship o f Kyrgyzstan.  
I hope that the signing by all parties of the Cholpon -Ata Agreement 
“On Friendship, Good Neighborliness and Cooperation for the Development 
of Central Asia in the 21st Century ” will open a new page in our interstate 
relations.  
We are committe d to continuing work in this format.  
  
Dear Secretary General,  
Dear Ladies and Gentlem en, 
 
At the end of my speech, I want to assure you that Kyrgyzstan fully 
supports the UN as the only universal structure authorized by all of us - the 
member states of the UN - to solve the challenges faced by humanity . 
I hope that the UN will continue to properly perform all its functions 
and assist member states in overcoming challenges and solving urgent global 
problems.  
I urge all member states to provide unconditional political support and 
solidarity to the Organization in this difficult international time.

Dear ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.", KGZ,2022
 KAZ_77_2022,"Statement  by 
H.E. Mr. Kassym -Jomart  Tokayev,   
President  of the Republic  of Kazakhstan,   
at the General  Debate  of the 77th session  of the UNGA  
(20 September,  2022 , New York) 
 
Mr. President,  
Mr. Secretary -General,  
Excellencies,  
 
First of all, I congratulat e Mr. Körösi  
(Кёрёши)  on his election  as President  of the 
seventy -seventh  session  of the General  
Assembly.  
We meet here at UN headquarter s at a 
critical  time for humanity .  
The world  of today  appears  to have entered  
a new, increasingly  bitter, period  of 
geopolitical  confrontation.   
The long-standing  international  system  - 
based  on order  and responsibility  is giving  way 
to a new, more  chaotic  and unpredictable  
one. 
 
The global  system  of checks  and 
balances  has failed  to maintain  peace  and 
stability.    
The security  architecture  is eroding.   
Mutual  distrust  between  global  powers  
is dangerously  deepening . 
The world  is falling  prey to a new set of 
military  conflicts .  
For the first time in two generations,  we 
face the prospect  of the use of nuclear  
weapons , and not even as a last resort.  
New fault lines are creating  artificial  
barriers  and economic  isolation.   
Economic  and political  sanctions  have 
become  “a new norm”  that erodes  the supply  
chains  that ensure  food security,  threaten ing 
millions , especially  in vulnerable  communities .  
These  problems  contribute  to the mounting  
challenges  of soaring  inflation , job losses,  
and fears of a worldwide  recession , 
especially  for developing  nations . 
 
Finally,  these crises  severely  hamper  the 
urgent  action  we all agreed  to combat  climate  
change  and enhance  sustainable  
development.   
Some  77 years  ago, the founding  members  
placed  within the UN Charter  the principles  
and norms  of international  law that have 
successfully  guided us ever since .  
There  is nothing  more  important  now than 
to return  to the foundational  principles  that 
lie at the root of this universal  organization.   In 
particular,  we must rethink  the linkages  
between  three  primordial  principles:  the 
sovereign  equality  of states,  the territorial  
integrity  of states,  and peaceful  
coexistence  between  states.    
These three  principles  are  
inter-dependent . To respect  one is to respect  
the other two. To undermine  one is to 
undermine  the other two. 
 
When  the global  disarmament  regime  – 
both conventional  and nuclear  – weakens,  
these  three principles  are threatened .   
Conversely,  as these  three principles  are 
respected,  they grow in strength .  
Together  they become  the basis  for 
greater  inter-state  cooperation  at every  
level:  sub-regiona l, regional,  and global.    
This is the global  prosperity  dividend . 
This system  of values,  embodied  in the UN, 
remains  a beacon  of hope for millions  of people  
in different  parts of our planet.    
We must staunchly  defend  these  values , 
the UN as its core, and the spirit of cooperation  
which  underpins  it. 
In other words,  we cannot  simply  shrug  our 
shoulders  and agree  with polarization  and 
division.  
We cannot afford indecision  or narrow  
interests  detrimental  to this common  heritage  
and our collective  good.    
Too much  is at stake. 
 
Therefore,  Kazakhstan  stands  ready  to 
cooperate  with all relevant  actors  in a spirit of 
inclusiveness , multilateralism  and 
goodwill .  
I am convinced  that the challenges  of our 
time can only be overcome  by countries  acting  
together.  
To achieve  our shared  goals,  we must  go 
forward  in the following  directions . 
The multiple  and often interconnected  
crises  of recent  years  have exposed  
significant  gaps  in global  governance .   
They have highlighted  the need to 
modernize  and reform  the United  Nations . 
The UN must be better  prepared  for future  
challenges  and opportunities.  In this respect,  
Kazakhstan  welcomed  the proposals  in the 
report  of the Secretary -General  entitled  
“Our  Common  Agenda.”   
This is an important  opportunity  to reaffirm  
the Charter  of the United  Nations,  
reinvigorate  multilateralism , boost 
 
implementation  of existing  commitments,  
agree  on concrete  solutions  to new 
challenges , and restore  trust among  
Member  States.  
We look forward  to contributing  to the 
consultatio ns at the ministerial  meeting  
next year and to the holding  of the 2024 
Summit  of the Future .  
We must move  from simply  responding  to 
global  challenges  and crises  to preventing  
and better  predicting  emerging  trends  and 
integrating  our assessments  into strategic  
planning  and policymaking.  
For this very purpose,  Kazakhstan  proposed  
30 years  ago the idea of convening  the 
Conference  on Interaction  and Confidence  
Building  Measures  in Asia (CICA) . 
In the context  of new challenges  and threats  
we hope to transform  CICA  into a full-fledged  
international  organization  at the upcoming  
summit  in October  to contribute  to global  
mediation  and peace -making . 
 
With only eight years  until 2030, the 
Sustainable  Development  Goals  are 
hampered  by the COVID -19 pandemic , a 
“triple  planetary  crisis” (climate  change,  
biodiversity  loss, and pollution ) and conflicts  
around  the world .  
We need to get back on track before  it's too 
late. 
Our top priority  must be to build resilience  
to future  turmoil  and ensure  a sustainable,  
equitable  and inclusive  recovery.   
To this end, we need a frank  dialogue  
between  East and West  and a new global  
security  paradigm  based  on the principles  
of mutual  trust and multifaceted  
cooperation .  
Given the current  crisis and increase d 
geopolitical  tensions,  there  is an acute  need  
for a process  under  UN auspices  that can 
lead to détente  and conflict  prevention .   
Kazakhstan  has suffered  terribly  from past 
nuclear  weapons  testing,  so we understand 
 
very clearly  the dangers  of escalati ng 
tensions  between  nuclear  powers.    
For this reason,  nuclear  disarmament  
has become  a key part of Kazakh  foreign  
policy  and we will be continuously  struggling  
for a world  free of nuclear  arsenals.    
Despite  some  progress  in this area, 
unfortunately , the whole  record  is not that 
positive.  We are alarmed  by the increased  
rivalry  and rhetoric  of Nuclear  States .  
We are also concern ed at the lack of 
progress  made  by the NPT review  
conferences .   
Elaborating  new mechanisms  to ensure  
disarmament  and nonproliferation  is a daunting  
task ahead.   
Similarly,  the COVID -19 pandemic  has 
highlighted  the urgent  need to manage  and 
reduce  biological  risks  and dangers.   
It should  be of universal  concern  that we still 
rely on the Biological  Weapons  Convention  – 
now 50 years  old – without  any effort to create 
 
an agency  or body for international  
cooperation.   
In this context,  I would  like to reiterate  my 
earlier  proposal  to establish  an International  
Agency  for Biological  Safety .  
Along  with threats  to international  security,  
climate  change  requires  greater  international  
cooperation  and solidarity  as well. 
Around  the world,  people  are facing  
existential  threats  from weather  and 
environmental  change.   
If we are to turn this tide, we need  more  
action,  and we need  it fast. 
Many  of us have taken  bold steps  already.  
In Kazakhstan,  we have pledged  the total 
transformation  of the oil- and coal-dependent  
energy sector  into a Net Zero economy  by 
2060.  
To save our planet,  we need investment  at 
greater  levels than we have ever seen. 
 
However , climate  action  cannot  come  at 
the expense  of development  or 
modernization . 
Therefore,  at COP27  later this year, 
member  states,  as well as the global  business  
community,  must once again  scale  up their 
commitment  to greater  climate  finance.   
That agenda  relates  directly  to the global  
food security  crisis .  My country,  as the 
world’s  seventh  largest  grain  producer , is 
the breadbasket  of Central  Asia. We are 
committed  to utilizing  this agricultural  
potential  to fight global  food insecurity.  
Kazakhstan  will continue  to act as a reliable  
supplier  of grain and other food-staples .  It also 
intends  to grow its cooperation  with the Islamic  
Food  Security  Organization,  located  in 
Kazakhstan , as well as UN agencies.  
It is imperative  in this connection  to 
exclude  food and fertilizers  from any 
sanctions  and restrictions  whatsoever .  
Once  again,  current  economic  and 
social  upheavals  require  a collective  effort. 
 
Commitment  to the 2030 Agenda  remains  
an integral  part of our national  and global  
agenda.   
In addition,  fair trade  regimes  are crucial  
to global  economic  recovery.  
In this context,  I would  like to commend  the 
constructive  decisions  coming  out of the      
12th WTO  Ministerial  Conference , chaired  
by Kazakhstan . 
The current  geopolitical  situation  also 
highlights  the importance  of a reliab le and 
diversifi ed global  transit  and transport  
infrastructure.  
We are seeing  this in our own region.  
Kazakhstan,  the largest  landlocked  
developing  country,  is becoming  a vital 
Asian  land corridor  to Europe.  
The Trans -Caspian  International  
Transport  Route , or Middle  Corridor  has 
received  a new impetus . We expect  cargo  
volume  through  Kazakhstan  to increase  
significantly  in the years  ahead . 
 
We must ensure  that the Caspian  Sea 
becomes  a sea of peace  and new 
opportunities.   
In the months  ahead,  Kazakhstan  will help 
mitigate  the most immediate  impacts  of limited  
access  to energy  and critical  raw materials  
caused  by trade and supply  chain  disruptions.  
In the long-term, we aim to diversify  our 
sources  of energy,  with a particular  focus  on 
green  hydrogen  and renewables.  
Speaking  about  Central  Asia, we should  
bear in mind that it has already  become  a 
region  of vast opportunities  for 
international  cooperation .  
Together  with our Central  Asian  partners , 
we are committed  to strengthening  political  
interaction  and deepening  economic  ties to 
move  our region  forward.   
We agreed  to coexist  as good  neighbors  
and diversif y our cooperation .  
This credo  is based  on our significant  
natural  and agricultural  resources,  human  
capital , transport  and transit  potential . We are 
 
a ""buffer  market""  between  East and West,  
South  and North.  
We intend  to work together  with all 
stakeholders  to address  a pressing  regional  
agenda  that includ es climate  change,  the Aral 
Sea, rational  use of water  resources,  border  
delimitation,  combating  extremis m, and 
expanding  intra-regional  trade.  
That is why we consider  it important  to 
establish  the UN Regional  Centre  for SDGs  
for Central  Asia and Afghanistan  in Almaty.   
 
Kazakhstan  sees the future  Afghanistan  
as a truly independent,  neutral,  united,  
prosperous  state,  living in peace  with its 
neighbors.   
Therefore,  we support  the difficult  
process  of nation -building  in that country,  
including  life-saving  humanitarian  
assistance . 
 
Dear colleagues , 
 
As President  of Kazakhstan  I am absolutely  
committed  to build a Just Kazakhstan , one in 
which  every  citizen  has the same  
opportunities,  rights,  and protections.  
Justice  in my country  must prevail.  Law and 
order  will become  pillars  of our society.   
The most important  part of this path is 
transformative  political  reform.  
Presidential  and parliamentary  
elections  will be held in Kazakhstan  over the 
coming  months.  According  to my proposal  the 
presidential  mandate  has been limited  to one 
seven -year term.   It is a real breakthrough  in 
developing  democracy  in Kazakhstan.  
At the same  time, we will be firmly  adhering  
to my formula  of a “Strong  President  – 
Authoritative  Parliament  – Accountable  
Government”.  I am convinced,  this formula  
excellently  serves  the national  interests  of 
Kazakhstan.   
We also aim to de-monopolize  the 
economy. 
 
We are taking steps  to ensure  that the 
wealthiest  in our society  play their part in 
our quest  for a Just Kazakhstan,  along  with 
diversify ing our economy  and increas ing 
investment s in human  capital .  
Recently,  I initiated  the creation  of a 
National  Fund  for Children . Starting  in 2024, 
50% of the investment  income  from the 
National  Welfare  Fund  will be allocated  to 
special  savings  accounts  for children  until their 
adulthood.  These funds  could  be used for 
education  or housing  purposes .  
A special  private  charity  fund “For the 
people  of Kazakhstan”  also now provid es 
assistance  to ordinary  citizens  for healthcare,  
education  and social  security  aims. 
We aim to further  expand  the 
empowerment  and participation  of women  
in economic  and public  life. 
Comprehensive  national  transformation  is 
not a simple  process,  and there  will certainly  
be pitfalls  and bumps  in the road. 
 
But, if we are firmly  to meet the 
expectations  of Kazakh  citizens,  we cannot  
deviate  from this strategic  path!  
Over the past three years  we have carried 
out substantial  transformations  through  four 
packages  of political  reforms.  
For example,  new laws passed  by the 
Parliament  simplified  political  parties’  
registration  and reduced  the threshold  for 
parties  to enter  Parliament  from 7% to 5%.  
To promote  a wider  involvement  of citizens  
in governance , there  is now a mandatory   
30 % quota  for women  and young  people  in 
electoral  party legislative  lists.  
To make  local administration  more  
accountable,  local mayors  are now directly  
elected .  
To foster  a more  open  culture  between  
society  and government,  we have changed  
the law on peaceful  assemb ly: government  
authorization  is no longer  required . 
 
Following  its international  commitments  on 
the fundamental  right to life and human  dignity,  
Kazakhstan  abolished  the death  penalty.   
A Just Kazakhstan  depends  on our  
multi -ethnic  and multi -confessional  
solidarity .  The “Unity  in Diversity”  principle  
will be preserved  at all costs. 
Last week,  the 7th Congress  of Leaders  
of World  and Traditional  Religions  was 
successfully  held in Kazakhstan.   
The Congress  once again  highlighted  the 
importance  of religious  tolerance,  dialogue,  
and mediation.  We are ready  to build bridges  
and provide  platforms  for dialogue  wherever  
needed.  
 
Dear friends , 
This year marks  30 years  of Kazakhstan  
– United  Nations  partnership . 
The Organization  has contribut ed strongly  
to the formation  and strengthening  of 
independent  Kazakhstan. 
 
Over that period , we have worked  for the 
aims of the Charter  in all major  UN organs , 
from ECOSOC  to the Human  Rights  
Council  to the Security  Council . 
Kazakhstan  will remain  at the forefront  of 
advancing  a more  modern,  efficient,  
transparent , and accountable  Organization . 
Never  in history  have we had such a need 
for responsible  leadership  for the next 
generations.   
Remembering  our past makes  us 
responsible  for our future.  
Together  with you, we will spare  no effort 
toward  building  a safer,  more  sustainable  and 
prosperous  global  community . 
Thank  you!", KAZ,2022
 KOR_77_2022,"Freedom and Solidarity: Answers to the Watershed Moment  
 
Mr. President,  
Mr. Secretary General,  
Distinguished delegates,   
 
I offer my sincere congratulations to  His Excellency  Mr. Csaba Kőrösi for 
assuming  the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly.  
 
I hope that the 77th session of the UN GA, under  your leadership,  will bring 
together the  wisdom of each member state so as to shape a better world.  
 
I also express my deepest respect to Mr. Secretary General Antonio Guterres  
for his tireless devotion as he embarks on  his second term.   
 
Under the United Nations Charter, we are called upon to endeavor to promote 
social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom  and to unite our 
strength to maintain international peace and security.  
 
When freedom of any individual in a nation comes under threat, members of the 
community must join hands to remove the threat  and defend  freedom. Likewise,when freedom of any citizen or nation in the global community is in peril, it is the 
community of nat ions that must stand together in solidarity to defend that  freedom.  
 
Our modern history testifies to the process of our solidarity and unity in 
safeguarding freedom and pushing  our civilization forward.  
 
Today, t he global community is yet again witnessin g freedom and peace of its 
citizens  put in jeopardy.  Attempts to alter the status quo by force endangers  the 
lives of innocent people ; nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction  
pose increasing threats to humanity; systemic violations of human r ights leave 
millions of children deprived of their future.  
 
Such threat s to freedom and peace must be overcome through  solidarity and  
fearless  commitment to the framework of universal global norms consolidated over 
the years within the UN system .    
 
The theme of the UNGA session this year , the “watershed moment” , encapsulates 
the gravity of the global crisis confronting us , which underscores  the solemn role 
of the UN .  
 
The first step in our journey to seek solution that will help us through these  
turbulent times to  find answers begins with solidarity and deference to theuniversally accepted global norms , working together throughout the  UN system  
which has been established  over the past decades .  
 
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General,  honorab le delegates.  
 
As humanity strives to defend freedom and build lasting peace , the UN’s role is 
indispensable . 
 
Genuine freedom is not just being free from the  shackles but having opportunities 
to live life to the fullest with dignity . Genuine peace is not an absence  of war but 
removing conflict and enmity that hold back shared progress of humanity and 
building the foundation for greater prosperity.   
 
Genuine freedom and peace can turn into reality when we are free from di sease 
and hunge r, free from illiteracy and free from want of energy and culture .  
 
In this regard , the United Nations  has been exerting great endeavors through the 
UNECOSOC and UNESCO, among others, yet is now urged to take on a broader 
role and responsibility.To tackle the challenges brought on  by the pandemic, the UN must play a central 
role in bringing the communit y of nations together to decisively step up  their 
support for countries with limited fiscal space and technical expertise.  
 
In pursuit of the  global agenda for decarbonization, countries with leading green 
technolog ies must work to  unsparingly  share new and renewable energy 
technologies with others .  
 
In the era of digital sophistication , one of the most  urgent tasks for the global 
community and the UN is p romoting global cooperation  to narrow  the digital 
divide  which  exacerbates polarization  between nations.  
 
Countries at the forefront of digital innovation must offer broader  assistance for 
digital education, technology transfer and investment while the UN must redouble 
its efforts  to mobilize support to that end.  
 
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary -General, and distinguished delegates,  
 
The Republic of Korea, notwithstanding the recent fiscal consolidation, scaled up 
support for  those who are in need  with resources secured through expenditure 
restructuring. At home, we are offering more assistance to socially vulnerable groups. 
Abroad, we increased our Official Development Assistance budget with a vision to 
achiev e a more inclusive development globall y.Just as broad ening support for the socially disadvantaged  groups lays the 
groundwork for sustainable prosperity, support for nations of the world facing 
challenges will render global freedom and peace more sustainable.   
 
As a responsible member of the international community, Korea is committed to 
playing its due responsibilit y and role for  the freedom of global citizens  and 
prosperity of the global community .  
  
Korea has accelerated research and development for Covid -19 therapeutics and 
vaccines, pledging 300 million dollars toward the ACT -A Initiative and 30 million 
dollars to the Financial Intermediary Fund of the World Bank, among others, thereby 
expanding its contribution s to build ing a more robust global health architecture.  
 
To ensure a more effective respon se to future infectious disease outbreaks, Korea 
will host a ministerial meeting of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) in 
Seoul this November. We are also taking part in ne gotiations to reach a pandemic 
accord under the World Health Organization .  
 
In addition, Korea will remarkably increase  its contribution to the Global Fund, 
joining forces with our partners in our fight against infectious diseases including 
AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.  
 
Turning to the issue of climate change, Korea will scale up  its green ODA, help 
developing countries transition to a low -carbon future and share its innovative green 
technologies with the entire humanity.Over the years, Korea has been transferring and sharing its e-government digital 
technology with developing countries and many others.   
 
The Republic of Korea  is pushing forward with its plan to transform t he government  
into a digital platform government.  It is an ambitious initiative to remarkably 
upgrade our democracy, public service, and welfare through digital technology.  
 
We will continue to more widely share our advanced  digital technology and data, 
and spare no effort in providing support and in investing in education .  
 
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary -General, distinguished delegates,  
 
As we seek  answers to the global crisis we are faced with, the viability  of the UN 
system and the universal global norms architecture is under  test.  
 
The crisis confronting us will only  be resolved when we stand firmly in solidarity to 
share the universal value of freedom and work together to uphold  and spread  our 
freedom.  
 
In this vein, we must more firmly support the system of the UN anchored in a spirit 
of freedom and solidarity as well as the normative frameworks that have thus been 
universally recognized in the international community.   
 
Any attempt to turn away from the UN system and universal norms will divide the 
global communit y into blocs, further compounding the crisis and turmoil.We must  more rigorously identify the nature and the roots of the problems that lie 
before us . The international community must vigorously endeavor to share  
responsibility  and join whenever necessary forces to resolve the challenges we face .  
 
Once again, I call upon global citizens  and leaders of the world for their resolute and 
enduring support for the UN system and universal global norms as we seek answers 
in this watershed moment .    
 
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary -General, distinguished delegates,  
 
The very first mission of the United Nations after its founding was to approve the 
Republic of Korea as the sole legitimate government on the Korean Peninsula, and 
to defend the freedom of my country  by sending over  UN forces during the Korean 
War.  
 
Thanks  to such efforts by the United Nations, Korea was able to become what it is 
today. As such, t he Republic of Korea will protect and expand the freedom of global 
citizens ; and together with the United Nations,  we will fulfill our responsibilities to 
promote peace and prosperity  around the world . 
 
Thank you.", KOR,2022

Mr President, Secretary -General, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
I would like to start by congratulating  Mr. Csaba Kőrösi for his election as the President of the 
seventy -seventh session of the General Assembly. I also want to thank Secretary -General 
António Guterres for his determined and skillful leadership of the United Nations. You can 
both count on Finland’s steadfast support for your important work  during these exceptional 
times .  
 
As the topic of this session states , the challenges we are facing are interlocking. Russia is 
waging a brutal war in Ukraine. The ripple effects of that war are already far -reaching and 
severe. They are compounding the pre -existing problems faced by the international 
community.  
 
A triple crisis of energy, food security and finance  is weighing especially heavily  on vulnerable 
countries . Countries that are  already suffering the most  from the climate crisis and the covid -
9 pandemic.    
 
This truly is a watershed moment.  As we gather here, we have an important opportunity to 
engage in  dialogue and to  find solutions. To understand the concerns of those most in  need.  
 
As difficult as it may seem, now is the time to show global solidarity  and strengthen 
multilateral cooperation.  The international community can and should emerge stronger from 
these crises.   
 
 
Mr. President,  
 
Russia’s cruel and unprovoked war on Ukraine has  now been raging  for seven months. It has 
brought immense sorrow and destruction to the sovereign lands of Ukraine. Russia’s use of 
force is in blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations . It is an act of aggression,  as 
determined by this  very  Assembly .  
 
Ukraine is exercising  its inherent right to  self-defence . And judging by the recent reports from 
the battlefields, it is doing that with admirable courage, strength and efficiency .  
 
We, the international community, members of this General Assembly, might not always see 
eye to eye. We have our differing views. But it is our common obligation to uphold the 
international rules -based order . We can’t  accept , condone  or normalize grave violations of 
international law  and human rights . A world where  impunity prevails  is unjust, unstable and 
dangerous. For all of us .*** 
 
There was a global food crisis even before the Russian invasion to Ukraine . More  than 800 
million people in the world  were  chronically hungry. The war further  worsens  this calamity.  
 
I would like to commend the UN Secretary -General and the President of Türkiye for their 
tireless efforts  to reach an agreement  to secure Ukrainian grain  transports. If implemented 
as foreseen, it will have a major impact on the lives of tens of millions of people in need .   
 
In order to respond to the wider challenges of global food security, we need  collective action . 
The goal must be sustainable, inclusive and fair food systems . We also have to accelerate the 
implementation of other Sustainable Development Goals . We can ’t afford to leave anyone  
behind.  
 
*** 
 
Last year in this hall , I noted that it is not an exaggeration to say that we are facing a global 
climate emergency. This summer  has proven it : we have seen extreme drought and heat 
waves across the globe . From the Horn of Africa to Europe , from China  to the US . The 
magnitude of  the catastrophe caused by the floods in Pakistan is not yet fully visible but the 
destruction  is already tremendous.    
 
These are not isolated or local events. They are, once again, a reminder that climate change  
is an existential  threat  to the human kind. We are on the verge of very dangerous tipping 
points.  
 
This calls for urgent action on two fronts. First, we must chan ge our course before it is too 
late. Second, we need to help  those urgently suffering and support  those with  fewer  
resources to deal with this threat.   
 
Besides mitigating climate change, we must adapt to it. In particular, we must honor the 
commitment of doubling adaptation finance made at the COP26 in Glasgow.  
 
And I want to underline this: Fighting climate change and taking care of  the economy are not 
contradicting each other. Green transition has a tremendous potential to create jobs, 
inno vations and economic growth. But it has to be done fairly.  
 
The alarming loss of the variety of life on our planet should also be a cause for grave concern 
to all of us . We are on the brink of mass  extinction, or perhaps already there. Again, we need 
to change course. Urgently.We humans can only  thrive and survive if we learn  to co -exist with all the other species. We 
need to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030. To this end, the COP15 in Montreal in 
December will be essential.  
 
*** 
Mr. President,  
 
defending  human dignity  is a fundamental task of the UN . It is up to us – the Member States 
– to live up to this task. Despite our  failures, we have also accomplishments to build on. The 
UN Human Rights Council has shown determination. It has worked to ensure accountability 
for the horrendous acts against civilians in Ukraine and Syria. It has raised its voice in support 
of women and girls in Afghanistan.  
 
I want to thank those who supported  Finland’s membership of the Human Rights Council. As 
a member, Finland acts to bring  justice  to the vic tims of human rights violations.  Finland 
remains a staunch supporter of the work of the Inter national Criminal Court in investigating 
all grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law . 
 
The number of conflicts  in the world  is the highest since the Second World W ar. One quarter 
of humanity lives in conflict -affected countries. W e must not ignore or forget Afghanistan, 
Myanmar, Syria, Yemen and other countries where human rights or the conditions for living 
a decent life are under threat.  
 
Increasing  geopolitical tensions as well as  the impact s of cl imate change and the pandemic 
are making conflicts more complex and prolonged . Ordinary people bear the brunt. For the 
first time in its history, the UNDP’s Human Development Index has declined for two 
consecutive years.  We simply can’t  let this continue.  
 
In this turbulent world, those who stoke the flames of conflict bear a special responsibility. 
But w e all must ask ourselves: Have we done all we can to avert violence? Have we  done what 
we can to make a positive change?  
 
Difficult times call for mo re diplomacy, not less. We must  build and strengthen peace and 
prevent conflict wherever possible. That is the very core of the United Nations.  
 
We also have to be able  to respond to emerging ris ks to peace and security . Move from 
hindsight to foresight. The Secretary General’s report Our Common Agenda provides us a 
blueprint for more effective multilateralism – paving a way to solutions to current and future 
global problems , strengthening peace .  It really is o ur common agenda, and Finland 
wholeheartedly supports its implementation . 
 
 
***In the current security environment the international arms control architecture is increasingly 
challenged.  On the one hand, political tensions erode the functioning of the existing 
architecture. On the other hand, new  technologies create new risks . But we can’ t let arms 
control fail.  On the contrary: it needs to be strengthened .  
 
For decades arms control has provided stability and predictability into great power 
relationship s and international relations.  To quote Dag Hammarskjöld: “disarmament is 
never the result only of the political situation; it is also partly instrumental in creating the 
politi cal situation.”  
 
The two biggest nuclear weapon  states  have a unique responsibility to advance nuclear  arms 
control and disarmament. T he others  need to follow suit.  It is in the interest of all of us that 
progress in nuclear arms control and disarmament continue s beyond the New START Treaty. 
We call on the Unites States and the Russian Federation to continue their dialogue on 
strategic stability with a view of achieving further cuts in their nuclear arsenals.  
 
*** 
 
Mr. President,  
 
the interl ocking  global challenges  demonstrate that  more than ever  we need a renewed 
commitment on multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core.  
 
We must not become indifferent or apathetic in the face of these multiple crises. We must 
not get used t o violations of international law  and human rights . Not close our eyes to the 
growing needs of the vulnerable. Not sleepwalk into a climate and biodiversity  catastrophe. 
Nor should we lose  sight of hope: There is still time to act.", FIN,2022

General  Debate  
 
77th session  of the United  Nations  General  Assembly  
 
 
 
 
 
20 September  2022  
New  York  
 
Check  against  deliveryDear  President  of the General  Assembly,  
Dear  Secretary  General,  
Excellenc ies, Ladies  and Gentlemen,  
This organisation  has a clear  purpose,  as spelled  out in Article  1 of the 
UN Charter.  ‘To maintain  international  peace  and security,  to develop  
friendly  relations  among  nations,  and to achieve  international  
cooperation.’   
Today,  most  of you would  probably  agree  that we are still far from  
achieving  this goal.  But that does not mean  we should  not try.  
Each  and every  member  of the UN has a responsibility  to protect  peace.  
In this, the Permanent  Members  of the UN Security  Council  have  a 
special  duty.  Instead,  today,  we see one of the five Permanent  Members  
openly  denying  the right  of another  UN member,  Ukraine,  to exist  as an 
independent  state.  Those  who break  the rules  themselves  have  no 
authority  to set rules  for others,  through  their power  of veto.  
The wrongs  of Russia’s  aggression  could  not be clearer.  141 countries  
deplored  Moscow’s  war against  Ukraine  in a General  Assembly  
resolution.  No veto at the Security  Council  can change  the fundamental  
truth.  The truth  that today,  rather  than protecting  global peace,  Russia  
is doing  everything  to undo  it.  
Moscow’s  aggression  has inflicted  harm  on the entire  world.  Thousands  
of innocent  Ukrainian  civilians  have  been  killed.  Millions  had to leave  
their homes,  triggering  one of the largest  refugee  crisis  in Europe’s  
history.  50 million  people  are on the brink  of starvation  in Africa  and 
Asia.  Russia’s  blockage  of Ukraine’s  ports  and confiscation  of its 
harvest  has made  the already  grave  global  food crisis  even  worse.  We 
welcome  the deal mediated  by the Secretar y-General  Guterres  and 
Türkiye.  And we call on Russia  to fully  unblock  all Ukraine’s  ports.  
Otherwise,  the world  will continue  to suffer.   
The democratic  world  and all of us must  be a voice  of Ukraine.  The 
voice  that won’t  be silent,  voice  that will continue  to testify  about  
Russia’s  crimes  in Ukraine.  The voice  that will remember,  and that will 
act - so no one is ever allowed  to commit  such atrocities  again.Excellencies,   
Vladimir  Putin  hoped  to conquer  Ukraine  and scare the rest of us. In 
this goal,  he has failed,  as Ukraine’s  recent  successes  on the battlefield  
demonstrate.  We will rebuild  peace.  To do so, we must  learn  from  our 
past mistakes.  This is not the first time we have  seen aggression  in 
Europe.  Russia  has occupied  parts  of Georgia  since  2008  and parts  of 
Ukraine  since  2014.  Our response  to these  actions  was incomplete.  
Concerns  about  our own comfort  weakened  our resolve.  The tepid  
sanctions  we imposed  failed  to discourage  Russia  from  trying  again.  
Our weaknes s encouraged  more  aggression.   
We must  not repeat  the same  mistake  again.  The ignorance  of rules  is 
poisoning  global  security,  and it must  not be allowed  to stand.   
More  than 50 countries,  including  all members  of the European  Union,  
have  already  imposed  tough  sanctions  on Russia.  Slovakia  is Ukraine’s  
direct  neighbour  - our own security  is impacted  by this war. We are 
neither  the biggest  nor the richest  country  in the world.  We have  long 
been  dependent  on Russia’s  energy  supplies.  But we chose  the 
protecti on of our fundamental  rules.  We have  imposed  sanctions  on 
Russia  and are supporting  Ukraine  including  through  military  aid. 
Because  Ukraine’s  fight  is just and defensive,  in line with international  
rules  and its rights  as a UN member.  I invite  all of you to join: we should  
all help Ukraine,  politically,  militarily,  financially.  Because  this is the 
only way how we can restore  peace.  
Honourable  Members,  
Russia’s  war in Ukraine  is not the only crisis  exposing  the gap between  
the rules  and commitments  we agreed  on and their practical  realisation.  
In November,  we will have  already  the 27th COP  summit  in Egypt.  But 
our actions  remain  dangerously  behind  our words.  Our greenhouse  gas 
emissions  are not falling  fast enough.  How  much  more  scorched  Earth,  
how many  millions  more  climate  refugees,  how many  flood  victims  
does it take to convince  us that ignoring  our commitme nts is no longer  
an option?  
We are desperately  behind  in cutting  our emissions.  Worse,  we hear 
voices  that argue  that climate  crisis  must  wait because  of increasing  
energy  prices.  This would  be a grave  mistake.  Yes, the price  increasesare painful  and we must help those  who risk losing  access  to energy  to 
heat their homes  or cook  their meals.  
But we must  not lose sight  of the bigger  picture.  We are talking  about  
the rising  prices  of commodities,  which  we must  phase  out anyway  to 
stop the planet’s  warming.  Rather  than bring  back  subsidies  for coal or 
gas, we must  transition  away  from  them.  Renewable  energy  is less 
dependent  on those  who are trying  to use gas or oil as an energy  
weapon.  And it is cheaper.  Despite  the current  energy  crisis,  Slovakia  
stops  using  coal as a source  of energy  next year.  We are investing  in 
renewables  and launching  a retrofitting  programme  for buildings  to 
boost  energy  efficiency.  Because  the cheapest  energy  is the one you do 
not use. 
We can only do this together,  globally  and in solidarity  with each other.  
We need  all big economies  to join and help those  who need  it. At this 
year’s  COP27,  we need  a significant  increase  of funds  for lower  and 
middle -income  countries.  Many  of them  contribute  very little to our 
planet’s  heating  but suffe r the most  from  its consequences.   
Excellencies,   
As the world  community,  we have  put short -term comfort  over lasting  
solutions  when  it comes  to two crises:  that of international  peace  order,  
and that of our climate.  But there  is a third  crisis  of relativi zation  of 
values,  facts  and expertise,  as well as a decrease  of trust in democratic  
institutions.  We are facing  an epidemic  of lies, propaganda  and 
disinformation.   
It is hardly  new,  but thanks  to the rise of social  media,  it is more  
powerful.  If algorithms  favour  hatred  over truth  or nonsense  over 
science,  if they appeal  to our instincts  rather  than the greater  good,  what  
hope  is there  for global  understanding?  Or for the sort of cooperation  
that the UN has been  created  to advance?  
Democracies  are tolerant  by default.  But they die if they start tolerating  
intolerance.  Along  with the rest of the European  Union,  Slovakia  leads  
the way for an effective  and democratic  regulation  of major  social  
platforms  and online  media.  Online  space  should  be guided  by the same  
democratic  rules  that apply  offline.  We welcome  UN initiatives  forrules  for state behaviour  in cyberspace.  The efforts  towards  a so-called  
Digital  Geneva  Convent ion are justified  and needed.  
The crises  I mention  have  a disproportionate  impact  on women  and 
girls.  This plays  out in higher  rates  of gender -based  and domestic  
violence,  greater  economic  insecurity  and poverty  or worse  access  to 
education  and health  care. However,  I am not here to portray  women  as 
victims.  I am here to call on all of them  to step up their engagement  in 
public  affairs.  Women  are agents  of change.  The world  has a collective  
responsibility  to support  them.  Because  we are already  seeing  the 
consequences  of a world  that is run without  taking  their unique  and 
diverse  experience  into proper  account.   
Ladies  and Gentlemen,  
Time  has not been  very favourable  to the ideas  that built and sustain  
this organisation.  The peace  we should  safeguard  is fraying in Ukraine.  
The international  cooperation  we should  foster  has not prevented  a 
climate  catastrophe.  And the spirit  of shared  global  commons  that the 
UN embodies  is under  attack  from  extremists,  their voice  multiplied  by 
new technologies.  Half measures  are not enough  to cope  with these  
challenges.  We have  tried that before.  It is time for action  and for 
clarity.   
We, the members  of the UN, need  to clearly  side with victim  over 
aggressor.  We must  choose  international  rules -based  order  over the 
power  of gun. We must  urgently  deliver  on our climate  goals.  And find 
working  rules  for social  media  platforms  to protect  the fabric  of our 
societies  and the international  order.  Sure,  we can delay  and 
compromise.  But again,  history  teaches  us that passivity  and ignorance  
never  solve  crises,  they only delay  the moment  of reckoning.  And since  
obeying  even  the smallest  of rules  matters,  let me finish  here to respect  
the agreed  time limit.  
Thank  you.", SVK,2022

HIS EXCELLENCY FERDINAND ROMUALDEZ MARCOS JR.  
President of the Republic of the Philippines  
General Debate  (Speaker No. 2 ) 
77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  
3:15p, Tuesday, 20 September 2022  
General Assembly Hall, UNHQ  
 
 
“A Call for Global Unity”  
 
Mister President,  Excellencies  
 
I am Ferdinand Marcos, President of the Republic of 
the Philippines  
 
I stand today on behalf of 1 10 million Filipinos.                   
At this time of crisis and opportunity, I bring with me 
the spirit of their enduring commitment to the ideals 
of our United Nations . 
 
This commitment is reflected in our solid contributions 
to the cause of peace and justice.  By shepherding the Manila Declaration of 1982, we helped affirm that 
differences should only be resolved through peaceful 
means.  By reinforc ing the predictability and stability 
of international law, particularly the 1982 United 
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ,                      
we provided an example of how states should resolve 
their differences: through reason and right.  
 
These two c ontributions provide useful guidance        
for our time.  Amidst challenging global tides,                     
an important ballast stabilizes our common vessel.  
That is , our open, inclusive, and rules -based 
international order that is governed by international 
law and informed by the principles of equity              
and justice.   As I have underscored, the Philippines 
shall continue to be a friend to all, and enemy                
of none.1 
 
This world order traces its roots to seventy -seven         
years ago.  Your first Asian predecessor , Mr. President , 
 
1 SONA, 25 July 2022 General Carlos P. Romulo, called on our leaders then 
to “make this floor our last battlefield, to determine in 
this hall whether humanity is to survive or be wiped 
out in another holocaust.”  Our peoples chose 
survival.  They chose cooperation.  They cho se 
peace.  And by doing so, they made history.  
 
Today, history once again calls to  us to make these 
choices .  We are confronted by tectonic shifts that 
will inform  the ebb and flow of the coming century.  
Of these, I see four challenges to the continued 
survival of our global community.  
 
First is climate change : The time for  talk about                    
if and when  has long since passed  -- it is here                
and now.  
 
Climate change is the greatest threat affecting  our 
nations and peoples.   There is no other problem so 
global in nature that it requires a united effort, one 
led by the United Nations. The effects of climate change are uneven and reflect 
an historical injustice:  Those who are least responsible 
suffer the most.  The Philippines is a net carbon sink, 
absorbing more carbon dioxide than we emit.           
And yet, we are the 4th most vulnerable country            
to climate change.  
 
This injustice must be corrected, and those who need 
to do more must act now.  
 
We accept our share of responsibility and will 
continue to do our part to avert this collective 
disaster.  
 
We call on industrialized countries to immediately 
fulfill their obligations under the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 
Paris Agreement to cut their greenhouse gas 
emissions, provide climate financing and technology 
transfer for adaptation  for the most vulnerable            
and developing countries , and lead by example. We look forward to concrete outcomes at the 
Conference of Parties in Egypt later this year.  
 
When future generations look back, let them not  ask 
why we did not take this opportunity to turn the tide, 
why did we  continue in our profligate ways ,                  
until it was too late?   This threat knows no border s,       
no social class, nor any geopolitical consideration.  
How  we address it  will be the true test of our time.  
 
Second, the development of advanced 
technologies is rapidly transforming human life           
and experience.  We still barely understand how 
these transformations are unfolding and where they 
are leading.  The imminent diffusion of these 
emerging technolo gies could solve many of our          
old problems, but they could also disrupt our political 
and social orders.  Our governance structures must 
keep up.  
 
Third, widening geopolitical polarities and sharpening 
strategic competitions are transforming the international political landscape.  A profound lack of 
trust is putting enormous strains on our multilateral 
system.  Our very Charter is being violated around the 
world  as we speak.  In Asia, our hard -won peace      
and stability is under threat by increas ing strategic 
and ideological tensions.  These behoove us                    
to uphold the ideal s that led to the establishment          
of this parliament of nations, and to reject any 
attempt  to deny or redefine our common 
understanding  of these principles.  
 
Even as we grapple with these new long -term shifts, 
we remain beset by an unresolved problem: 
Inequalities and inequities within and among 
countries persist, and they  continue to  demand 
urgent action.   Therein lies our fourth transcendent 
challenge.  
 
This injustice was evident during this pandemic,        
when the richer nations immediately received  
vaccines at the expense of the have -nots.  We see , for example  dangers of this lurking in the persistent 
digital divide and in bal looning debt burdens . 
 
As we awaken from the economic stupor caused  
by the pandemic, we must reinvigorate the world 
economy.  We must use public and private 
resources to encourage the expansion of trade, 
investment, and technology transfers to accelerate 
development.   Knowledge and intellectual gains 
must flow freely to allow those lagging behind               
to catch up.  Sustainable development will be 
hampered, to the detriment of all, if existing 
structures in the global economy remain 
unre formed.  
 
Mister President,  
 
In these past three decades, Filipinos have achieved 
significant strides on our path to sustainable 
development.  Despite the challenges of the 
pandemic and the global economic upheavals ,        
we remain on track to reach upper middle -income status by next year.  With steady investment in food 
security, public health, education, and other social 
services, we expect to become a moderately 
prosperous country by 2040.  I am confident that         
we will achieve this vision.  
 
Yet no nation stands alone .  The achievement of our 
national ambition requires a global environment       
that creates conditions that allow all nations, 
including ours, to thrive in peace.  We need the 
United Nations to continu e to work.  And we,                 
the Philippines, are determined to be part of the 
solution.  
 
The Philippines did not hesitate to donate to the 
COVAX facility  that helped provide vaccine s in many 
parts of the developing world.  Multilateralism and 
international cooperation make a difference.   
Filipino health workers were at the frontlines                       
in many countries to curb the spread of the virus, 
risking and oftentimes  sacri ficing their own lives               
to save those of others.  
We have always been an optimistic and courageous 
nation.  Despite the enormity of these challenges,   
we believe that solutions are within our collective 
grasp.  You, Mister President, have alr eady identified 
the three  tools at our disposal.  
 
First, solidarity  : We need to reaffirm the wisdom of the 
founders  of our United Nations. This means 
transcending our differences and committing                 
to ending war, upholding justice, respecting          
human rights, and maintaining international peace                
and security.  
 
Nuclear weapons continue to pose an existential 
threat despite our efforts to build norms that 
resoundingly prohibit them .  We must reject the 
notion of deterrence  and remain committed                  
to decreasing the global stockpile of these weapons.      
At the same time, we must also address the scourge 
of the proliferation of all weapons, be they small arms, 
light wea pons, or improvised explosive devices.  
Our work must also focus on ensuring that the 
international system remains fair not only for all 
states, but more importantly for all peoples.                  
This system must work for the most vulnerable, 
especially the marginalized, migrants and refugee s. 
The world has witnessed the enduring contribution  
of migrants in the fight against the pandemic.                  
We still dream of  an end to the disturbing incidents            
of racism , of Asian hate , of all prejudice.  
 
The Philippines’ United Natio ns Joint Program                  
on Human Rights is an example of a constructive 
approach that puts our people, not our politics,             
at the center of our work.  It provides a model                 
for revitalizing the structures that facilitates solidarity 
between the United Nations and a sovereign            
duty -bearer.  
 
Our continued solidarity will also benefit from                     
a reformed and more inclusive Security Council         
and an empowered General Assembly that can hold the Council to account.  At the same time,                     
the United Nations must forge ahead with its flagship 
tradition of global peacekeeping.  
 
My country’s experiences in building peace              
and forging new paths of cooperation can enrich 
the work of the Security Council.   To this end I appeal 
for the valuable support of all UN Member States               
for the Philippines’ candidature to the                    
Security Council for  the term 2027 -2028.  
 
Our success in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region 
of Muslim Mindanao  in Southern Philippines                     
is the centerpiece of these efforts.   The peace that 
we have forged after many decades of conflict  
among warring factions and cla nsmen 
demonstrates that unity is possible even in the most 
trying circumstances.  Inclusive dialogue involving  
all stakeholders, including women, the youth,           
faith leaders and civil society, conducted with 
patience and good faith has produced a credible 
and solid foundation for self-government  that paves way for lasting peace and sustainable 
development.  
 
We take the same approach in Asia .  The Philippines 
builds partnerships for peace and development  
through dialogue, including through inter -faith            
and inter -religious dialogue especially through 
ASEAN .  In the face of great diversity, w e believe        
that partnerships form the bridge to unite us                       
in promoting peace and stability in  the Asia Pacific 
region.  
 
Our global community is only as strong as we make it .  
We need to ensure that all nations, especially 
developing countries, are equipped with t he tools 
they need to navigate the uncharted waters                   
of this century.  This requires a transformative 
development agenda.  We therefore welcome          
the Summit of the Future next year as an opportunity 
to collectively roll up our sleev es and chart                             
our common path. Second, sustainability  : We must seek solutions that 
preserve our planet.  These solutions must transcend 
our time and win the future for the succeeding 
generations.   We crafted the 2030 Agenda                    
for Sustainable Development as a platform of unity 
where our societies can build a future that is resilient 
and inclusive, where our people can be healthy, 
happy and secure.2 
 
This requires investment in food security, the fragility 
of which has been demonstrated by the pandemic 
and the conflict in Ukraine.  We need to take 
concrete steps towards a modern and resilient 
agriculture.   Food is not just a trade commodity         
nor a livelihood.  It is an existential imperative,           
and a moral one.3  It is the very basis of human 
security.  
 
 
2 A rephrasing of Ambisyon Natin 2040: a future that is strongly rooted, comfortable and secure.  
3 SONA, 25 July 2022 // To attain food self -sufficiency and security,                    
we are providing innovati ve solutions and financial 
support to farmers and fisher -folk to adapt new 
technologies and connect to national and global 
value supply chains.   We look forward to forging 
cooperation with the UN and our partners to boost 
agricultural productivity and food  security.  
 
As host to 17 UN agencies, program and funds, the 
Philippines strongly supports reforms to ensure that the 
UN Development System delivers as one through its 
UN Country Team.  
 
 
 
 
Water connects our world and sustains our existence, 
but it is also a finite resource that requires our 
stewardship.  Equally important, our biodiversity must 
be protected amidst the continuing challenge               
of climate change.  We must enhance our 
cooperation in these areas.  
But sustainability also requires development policies 
that go beyond the traditional metrics.  We already 
know that the Gross Domestic Product is an 
incomplete measure of progress and that 
vulnerability is multidime nsional.  Our development 
agenda must also take into account the interest of all 
developing nations, including middle -income 
countries where the majority of the world’s poor live.  
 
At the same time, sustainability means equipping our 
people with the tools they need to meet the 
challenges of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
Investments in education are key, and my 
administration is prepared to make these 
investments.  The Philippines  notes with  appreciat ion 
the Transforming Education Summit held earlier this 
week.  
 
There is perhaps no greater renewable resource than 
the creativity and innovation of the youth.                       
We understand the value of harnessing our people’s talents by creating a robust creative economy.            
We will continue to  work with partners in promoting 
this at the international level.  
 
Finally, science  : Knowledge and discovery remain 
the keys to unlock the potential of our dynamic 
future.  Encouraging our young people's curiosity, 
honing their skills, and protecting their intellectual 
properties are important investments.  
 
Humankind is pushing back its h orizons, both in the 
digital world and out in our physical universe .         
Access to these domains is an inalienable right of all 
nations, as are peaceful uses of all existing and 
emerging technologies.  The Philippines  is preparing 
for the future by lay ing the governance framework 
that will allow us to harness the power of renewable 
energy, develop the capacity to utilize the life 
sciences such as medicine and virology, pursue 
digital solutions towards a more modern economy, 
and expand our presence in ou ter space. But we also need to update the global structures that 
facilitate international cooperation on the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy, biology,                       and 
chemistry.  At the same time, we need new structures 
to govern rapid advances in other areas.  We need 
to start by defining the norms of responsible behavior 
in cyberspace and outer space and forming legal 
rules that will prevent the weaponization of artificial 
intell igence.  
 
The diffusion of cutting -edge  technology across the 
economy is promising, but they could come at a cost.  
Our development agenda must consider the possible 
displacement of human labor as a result of advances 
in automation.  We must prepare our economic 
structures for this.  We should start building the 
necessary  supports for those sectors affected.   
 
Mister President,  
 
The transcendent challenges of our time are as 
consequential as those that faced us seventy -seven years ago when we founded this august body.          
We are, indeed, at a watershed moment; one that 
requires a re -founding of these, our United Nations.  
 
Mister President, Your Excellencies,  
 
The world is ready for transformation.  It is up to us          
as leader s of our nations, to move and shape that 
transformation.  
 
The future beckons and we can embark upon that 
journey as single nations or as a world in harmony.            
I say let the challenges of one people be the 
challenges for all nation s.  In that way t he success         
of one will be a success for us all.  
 
The peoples of the world look to their leaders,                   
to us, to make into reality these aspiration s for our 
future.   We must not fail them.  And if we stand 
together , we will not fail them.  If we stand together, 
we can only succeed. Let us dream, let us work for those successes for all  our 
nation s, united!  
 
Thank you and good day!", PHL,2022

                                              Address  
by H. E. Gitanas Nausėda  
President of the Republic of Lithu ania 
at the UNGA 77th Session  
New York, 20 September 2022  
 
Dear President of the General Assembly,  
Dear Secretary  General,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Standing in front of this honorable assembly of world nations  I wanted 
to speak about peace.  About challenges that the world is facing today : 
income inequality, pandemics, climate change . Unfortunately  today I 
have to speak about war . The war in Europe. The war which only 
deepens  - not resolves - all other issues.   
Ever since the founding of the United Nations, its central idea has been 
bringing  countries together  and ensuring peaceful coexistence . After 
the terrible sufferings  of the Second World War, addressing global 
threats to international peace and security was the overriding concern.  
We owe a lot to those past leaders who struggled  to recreate  global order 
out of profound  disorder. The darkest hour in human history  inspired  
creating  the rules which  remain essential to the global co-existence of 
nations .  
For the first time in our history, peace ha d finally become a global value 
to be protected. Against all odds , the language of military aggression 
and conquest was condemned. 
 In the context of global challenges we often talk about human rights. 
But what about the right of countries to be sovereign and to defend their 
territorial integrity?  
On the  24th of Februar y a UN Security Council  permanent member 
started an unjustifi ed, unprovoked, and illegal war  against a 
neighboring country . This gross violation of international law  
undermin ed the very essence of  the United Nations .  
For the last seven months, Russia’s war against Ukraine has been  taking 
a terrible toll on the Ukrainian people. Many thousands  have been 
tortured and killed , millions were displaced or forced to flee their 
homeland.   
However, this war has not broken the will of the brave Ukrainian people  
to defend their country . It has not diminished their fighting spirit. 
Massacres at Bucha and I zyum have not brought them to their knees  
[nyz] . The inherent love for freedom, passed from one generation to 
another, is still there. Undefeated . Unspoiled.  
Despite al l challenges, Ukrain ians proved to be  remarkably  strong 
defender s of liberty  and democratic values. Inspired by  their heroic 
struggle, the international community  should  take an even more active 
role to booster  Ukrain ian resilience  to withstand this hardship.  
Every UN member is expected to respect the rules of international order 
we have been creating through  decades. But it is only up to u s to decide 
what is still tolerable and what is not.  Where are the red lines and were 
the red lines crossed.  
For how can we tolerate  a member of international community in a war 
of conquest and annihilation? A country that is deliberately  attacking 
the rules -based world order . A country whose actions make it more 
difficult for us all to maintain peace and security  across the globe . 
 Today I  call on all of you.  Look at what is happening in Ukraine .  Look 
at it attentively. Who is the aggressor and who is the victim? Behind the 
mask of an “energy superpower” there is a dangerous imperial  power 
seeking  to occupy and annex  its neighbors.  Searching for reasons to 
justify that annexation. Rewriting history. Using economic and energy 
blackmail . Spreading disinformation and propaganda.  
We all know that  Russia’s violation s of the founding principles of the 
United Nations  did not start seven months ago . Destructive actions  have 
undermined international security  for many years. B reaching arms 
control treaties. U sing prohibited chemical weapons both at home and 
abroad . Continually violating the territorial integrity not only of 
Ukraine  but of Georgia and Moldova  as well . Interfering in the elections 
of other countries.  These are just a few examples.   
The ongoing  suffering of the Ukrainian people was further amplified by 
Russia’s proxy – the Belarus ian [belarusijan]  regime . It has enabled 
military attacks of other country from its territory. It continues to 
provide support for offensive operations  against Ukrain e. 
Unfortunately , it has surrendered  the Belarusian national  sovereignty  to 
its big neighbour.  
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
These past few months have also revealed  the danger  of a looming 
nuclear disaster in Europe. The d eployment of Russian military 
personnel and weaponry at the Zapor izhzhia nuclear plant  is alarming 
and totally unacceptable . It disregards the safety  and security principles 
that all members  of the International Atomic Energy Agency  have 
committed to respect.  A nuclear power plant should never be used as a 
military base ! 
 Moreover, Russia’s irresponsible rhetoric  on the possible use of nuclear 
weapon s directly contradicts its role as a P5 [py faiv]  state and the 
commitment it has made in the January P5 Leaders’ Statement on 
Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races. We see a  huge gap 
between declarations and real actions which under mines the trust in one 
of the permanents members of the UN Security Council.  
We must collectively condem n such actions and require it to  
immediately and unconditionally withdraw all troops from the entire 
territory of Ukraine . It must also stop irresponsible and dangerous 
nuclear rhetoric and behavior . This should include  withdrawing 
military and other personnel from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power 
Plant . 
Therefore, Lithuania welcomes the active personal involvement of the 
Secretary -General  of the U nited Nations  in this regard . His visits to 
Ukraine demonstrate supreme dedication to the ideals of the United 
Nations.  
Lithuania notes that the  efforts of  the Secretary -General and Türkiye 
[tiurkije]  were instrumental in reaching the deal to resume Ukrainian 
grain exports.  We also  acknowledge the positive role played by other 
actors such as the African Union leadership in coming to this 
arrangement.  
This is an achievement shared by the whole community of nations . 
Once again, international efforts have helped us to avert a global 
catastrophe. Grain exports via Ukrainian ports will sustain and feed 
millions of people .  
Let us not doubt – it was the war in Ukraine  that threatened to trigger 
a global hunger . We cannot rest assured that this  danger will not come 
back until the Russian armed forces are withdrawn from the whole 
territory of Ukraine . 
 Ladies and Gentlemen,  
There must be no impunity for the brutal crimes and atrocities 
commit ted during the war . Guaranteeing  justice and accountability is of 
vital importance from the standpoint of credibility  of the United Nations 
and the international community .   
We should consolidate and advance our legal efforts. We must ensure 
that all those responsible for th is unprecedented assault on Ukrainian 
and European peace and security are held accountable.  
Lithuania will continue to engage in accountability mechanisms to 
address the mass atrocities being committed in Ukraine . I call on the 
global community to  establish the Special Tribunal to address  the war 
crime s. It is also  crucially important to ensure effective forms of 
reparation s for the victims of these crimes.  
Finally,  
We must take into consideration th at the war in Ukraine is an extension  
of the wider context.  
What we can see in Russia is  a further de cline  of civil liberties  as well 
as the grow ing brutality  of repressions . The h uman rights situation is 
deteriorating . Independent m edia and non -governmental organizations 
are being simply banished .  
Similar  developments are taking place in Belarus . Systematic and 
widespread attacks target  civil society, human rights defenders , and 
independent media. The number of political prisoners in Belarus  has 
exceeded one thousand two hundred - and continues to grow. This is 
truly alarming and requires more attention from the international 
community. 
 Lithuania has provided asylum t o Russian s and Belarusian s – 
representatives of non-governmental organizations  and independent 
media  – who were persecuted in their home countries .  
For Lithuania, the time of the business -as-usual approach  is gone . We 
have demonstrated  it by building the energy independence  and 
proceed ing faster with the green transition . I invite all countries to stop 
financing the bloody war by buying aggressor’s  energy resources.  It 
would s ignificantly  affect its ability to continue this brutal  war. 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Since the first days of this terrible war, Lithuania has be en support ing 
Ukraine.  We have not been silent. We have stepped up to help Ukraine 
in every way we can. Our government as well as civil societ y have been 
active in providing both military and humanitarian aid.  We have taken 
in more than sixty  thousand refugees, mostly women and children. To 
help them  maintain a sense of belonging, we have established a 
Ukrainian center in Vilnius  – the first center  of its kind outside Ukraine . 
This war must  end. But n ot in a peace at any cost . The Ukrainian 
territorial integrity has to be fully restored . Any other outcome would 
mean further atrocities and long -standing insecurity .  
While the aggressor  has already demonstrated  its eagerness to endanger  
the global population , we should not allow ourselves to be frightened.  
The danger is real . As history shows, to  push  back  against the aggressor 
is the only viable option ! 
Today I remain a strong believer in the transformative power of 
collective action . It is based on the principles of democracy, human 
rights , and the rule of law. Together  we can ensure global peace and 
security. Together  we will  make a difference. 
 Let me assure you: Lithuania is – and will always be – a valid partner 
in fighting for the right cause. In fighting for the long -lasting peace.  
Thank you!", LTU,2022

at the  
 General Debate of the 77th Session  
of the United Nations General Assembly  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
New York, 20 September 2022/5 
 Mr. President of the General Assembly,  
Mr. Secretary General,  
Excellencies,  
 
We live in difficult times. Our predecessors, who adopted the Charter of the United 
Nations, were “determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. Almost 
eight decades later, peace is still under threat, this time from worrying new challenges – the most 
severe since the end of the Second World War.  
We are witnessing, since February 24th, the dramatic consequences of the unprovoked 
and illegal  war started by the Russian Federation, a permanent member of the Security 
Council, against Ukraine . 
We are also witnessing exceptional solidarity from numerous countries united in 
their support for Ukraine , a sovereign member of this Assembly and a victim of months of 
aggression against its civilians, basi c infrastructure and economy.  
The consequences of this war are global and are not limited to our security . They 
refer to blatant violations of norms and principles of international law, including international 
humanitarian law and fundamental human rights,  and on sustainable development worldwide. 
These should be of major concern for all of us, irrespective of how far we are from the 
conflict .   
Distinguished colleagues,  
There is  no justification for a military aggression against a sovereign state .  
There i s no justification for bloodshed, destruction and human suffering . It is our 
joint responsibility to come together and uphold our common values as members of the United 
Nations.  
Democracy and universal human rights  are legitimate aspirations for all human kind. 
We therefore need to act now and support all who fight for freedom and democracy . We 
should guarantee the respect of the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of all 
States./5 
 Romania supported and will continue to support Ukraine as it s people are also fighting 
for our values and democracy.  
Romania opened its frontiers and its heart to all those seeking refuge from the war in 
Ukraine. Since the beginning of the conflict, over 2.3 million  Ukrainians have crossed our 
borders .  
Romania ha s offered not only emergency assistance, but also medium and long -term 
support for those who decided to stay in our country, with free access to education, health 
services and the labor market. In addition, we offered direct humanitarian assistance and put  in 
place a logistic hub for coordinating the international humanitarian assistance from the entire 
world. Our support will not stop here.  
We know that our response, especially to this war, will shape our common future. Our 
support for peace should be voi ced now, louder than ever .  
In defending our universal values, it is essential to stay united and bring everyone on 
board, including those who are still hesitating. Engagement and dialogue are crucial to 
overcome divisions and, at the same time, to counter  the spread of falsehoods and 
propaganda . 
Distinguished audience,  
The challenges we face today, such as the impact of climate change and loss of 
biodiversity, energy insecurity, lack of access to food and education, and social inequities , 
are becoming more  and more severe. They need responses and solutions , as our citizens are 
rightfully asking for them. For all these issues, common action  is the only way forward .  
 Energy security is a global concern, requiring joint solutions and responsible 
action.  We mu st avoid the use of energy as a tool of blackmail . Energy security requires 
strategic investments  in renewables, in nuclear power - with new future -oriented projects 
such as small modular reactors - or in hydrogen . It also requires energy prices that are 
accessible  for our citizens.   
Ensuring energy security goes hand in hand with the green transition  for resilient and 
climate -neutral economies./5 
 The nexus  between climate change and peace and security should be more prominent 
in our discussions, including in the Security Council.  
Despite our efforts, we have not moved past the triple crisis of climate change, 
pollution and biodiversity loss . All our efforts in the European Union, and in coordination with 
international partners, are meant to identify and im plement the best solutions to these serious 
difficulties.  
In two months’ time, we shall meet in Egypt for the COP27 and additional commitments 
towards climate neutrality are necessary, along with the implementation of the decisions already 
made. The clock is ticking, our Planet cannot wait any longer.   
Raising awareness, educating future generations on environmental protection and 
fighting climate change  is of utmost importance and a topic very close to my heart.  
Education is a top priority for Romania , and a strategic investment in our future. Thus, 
we also look forward to the Summit of the Future , to be held in 2024.  
 
Ladies and gentlemen,  
Weaponizing access to food and restricting it around the world are unacceptable. In order 
to support the Ukrainian economy and help manage the global food crisis, Romania has acted 
in a responsible way by facilitating the export of more than 4 million tons  of Ukrainian 
grain,  which represents 60% of the grain exported by Ukraine, through our ports on the Danube 
and at the Black Sea, since the beginning of the crisis.  
 
We also commend the role of the UN Secretary General in reaching the Black Sea 
Grain Init iative , which is, as he symbolically put it, a beacon of hope in a world that truly 
needs it.  
 
Distinguished audience,  
Romania has been arguing for a long time to keep the so-called protracted or frozen 
conflicts high on our agenda and to focus on how to solve them./5 
 The war against Ukraine taught us  that,  in such contexts, the absence of war does 
not mean peace.  Protracted conflicts such as those in the Black Sea region need to be 
addressed without delay . 
Distinguished delegates,  
United Nations peacekeepi ng has always been an instrument of paramount importance 
in safeguarding peace and security .  
Romania’s solid contribution to various operations around the globe stands proof of 
our commitment.  We need to ensure that, in line with the Action for Peacekeepi ng agenda , the 
UN peacekeeping missions become more effective and contribute to political solutions to 
conflicts , placing human rights  at the core of their action.  
We also need a steadfast action of the international community to protect and promote 
human  rights . We must strengthen the UN Human Rights system  and ensure sustainable and 
adequate funding of all its activities.  
We recognize the essential role played by civil society actors and the human rights 
defenders in the promotion and protection of human rights. Ensuring proper functioning of 
democratic institutions , upholding respect for the rule of law  and guaranteeing the 
fundamental rights and freedoms remain fundamental. It is with these firm convictions that 
Romania has presented its candidacy for a seat in the UN Human Rights Council , for the term 
2023 -2025.  
Distinguished audience,  
I would like to conclude by stressing that we need to restore public trust in effective 
multilateralism . Only together will we be able to identify and implement sustainable solutions 
in order to achieve world peace, prosperity, fulfillment of human rights and a healthy 
environment for the future generations!", ROU,2022
 MHL_77_2022,"H.E. Mr. David Kabua President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  General Debate New York 20 September 2022 check against delivery
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, I bring you warm greetings of Yokwe from the People and Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.  I also bring these greetings at an uncertain global hour.  Geo-strategic tension has risen in both Eastern Europe and the Indo-Paciﬁc. The Blue Paciﬁc continent and, in particular the Micronesian region, are no exception - indeed we are a unique front line.  
As one of the last nations in the world to reopen its borders, following our recent community COVID outbreak, we join the international community in both mourning our loss, while also thankful for partnership.  
We value the United Nations as our primary international stage.  
But if the world does not adequately respond to the island nations, and as seas rise, then there is really no United Nations at all.
For the Marshall Islands, our ﬁrst and most threatened priority is to never cease to safeguard our nation’s land, ocean and maritime boundaries, as seas are rising, and to ensure our communities have a safe, secure and fully democratic sovereign future.  Our vulnerabilities, and those shared in our region, are severe and diverse.  
We join many others, and especially our Paciﬁc island neighbors, in condemning Russia’s continued aggression and war crimes in Ukraine.  We do so not only as a United Nations member, but also in response to a wider global instability - which directly impacts our own islands region.  
Russia and all related actors will be held to account, as actions have consequences.  The Republic of the Marshall Islands stands proudly as a co-chair of the Group of Friends of Accountability following the aggression against Ukraine, and supports the independent investigations of the UN Human Rights Council and International Criminal Court.  
1The war in Ukraine has inﬂuenced sharp economic shocks around the world, and as a remote, small island developing state, our energy security is at a saturation point.  Even as we seek to boost eﬃciency and renewables, greater cooperation is needed to move towards regional approaches to energy security and aﬀordability, including addressing potential joint bulk purchasing.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands condemns the recent military actions of the Peoples Republic of China in the Taiwan strait.  This has threatened to disrupt peace and security in the Indo-Paciﬁc region and across the globe. 
We welcome recent IAEA monitoring reports on the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station and look forward to continued engagement through appropriate fora.
Mr. President, While we have shared goals and a strong partnership with the United States of America, we also have grave development challenges and essential needs to better assure present and future Marshallese generations of their growth and well-being.  We welcome recent progress with the United States of America towards a renewed Compact of Free Association and with it a targeted trust fund.  It is vital that the legacy and contemporary challenges of nuclear impact testing be better addressed, that climate change be addressed with the urgency and commitment it deserves, and that our voice as an equal partner is strengthened.  We know that the United States stands tall for its renewed engagement with the Paciﬁc Islands, and it is essential for all of us to ensure that words are met with actions.
Mr. President, As the Marshall Islands, we stand gravely concerned at an increasingly polarized world where nuclear weapons testing and detonation are only growing in risk.  We condemn the threats of further nuclear testing, and the threat of nuclear warfare.  And we have humanitarian concerns of our own, shared by a great many other nations, over any nuclear detonation or the risk thereof.  And here the Marshallese people also have a unique voice.  
 
My country, the Marshall Islands, was ground zero for the testing of the 67 nuclear and thermonuclear weapons for twelve years during the UN-US administered trusteeship era. The exposure of our people and land has created impacts that have lasted – and will last – for generations. These impacts to our human rights, land, culture, health and lives, are burdens that no other nation or country should ever have to bear.
 
Our own experience, history, and current challenges to nuclear exposure are key drivers for urging progress in reducing - and ultimately eliminating - nuclear risk. We welcome eﬀective and meaningful progress on this from major powers and nuclear weapons states, and from all states - in whatever form it can eﬀectively be achieved.  
2Mr. President, As a member of the Paciﬁc Islands family, we rally and acknowledge that the greatest challenge and threat is Climate Change.  As a low-lying atoll nation, whose future is at risk, there could be no stronger statement.  Nor should climate change be considered in isolation - tackling complex adaptation measures within a wider fragility makes our task just that much more diﬃcult.
Today, as I enter this iconic hall, the symbol of humanity’s hope and aspiration for world peace, prosperity, and international cooperation, my thoughts ﬂashed back 31 years, when the ﬁrst president of the Marshall Islands addressed this eminent Assembly, and called attention to the dangers faced by our small nation due to the looming threat posed by global warming. Over thirty years ago, in this great hall and at the Rio Summit, our leaders sounded the alarm and warned of its dire consequences. As a matter of record, Marshallese presidents and leaders in every succeeding administration have been active and at the forefront of all UN global conferences on climate change and global warming - speaking out and ﬁghting to keep our low lying nation aﬂoat. Today, we renew our call to the world to declare total war on this century’s greatest challenge - the climate change monster.
And yet, after all these years, the world has  failed to break our addiction to fossil fuels. We are not investing enough in life-saving adaptation, particularly for small island states.  We see the toll of this global crisis; how much worse will this be if we breach 1.5 degrees Celsius?
The IPCC has been clear: solutions exist that can give us a ﬁghting chance.
COP26 delivered vital progress. As the convener of the High Ambition Coalition, we believe without question that the Glasgow Climate Pact must be the foundation for a safer future.
We must honor these commitments and deliver enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions, and  policies on coal and fossil fuel subsidies to reach those targets.
We must build that future by catalyzing transformations today. By drastically increasing renewable energy. By taking on tough sectors like aviation and shipping. The Marshall Islands has proposed a carbon levy for international shipping that will drive the transition to zero emission shipping, channeling resources from polluters to the most vulnerable. I humbly urge all countries to embrace this at the International Maritime Organization.
Mr. President,  I see hope in elaborating a global goal on adaptation that will set our collective sights on a safe, resilient future.  Delivering adaptation at the scale required, calls for bold and 3substantial investment. The doubling of adaptation funding is a vital start. But like all climate ﬁnance,  we must see it delivered to the most vulnerable.
Loss and damage to property, and human suﬀering, are already occurring, with profound human rights impacts.  This must be addressed, including through a ﬁnance facility that will help those on the frontlines. This is a question of giving hope to those of us that face immeasurable threats – to our people, nation, and culture.
Mr. President, We are pleased to note and support the establishment of the human right to a clean environment, and of a special rapporteur for climate change and human rights. As a small island developing state, we are committed to better understanding and addressing complex challenges in human rights around the world, but development is never a trade-oﬀ for aﬃrming universal human rights.  Our own national experience tells us that politics must never step over the voices of the most vulnerable.  
We welcome the recent release by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights of a long-delayed report on the human rights situation in the Xianjing region of the People’s Republic of China.  We are gravely concerned regarding the report’s ﬁndings that “serious human rights violations have been committed” and that widespread arbitrary detention “may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.”  The international community cannot bear silent witness, and must react.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands also aﬃrms the role of the Paciﬁc Islands Forum in addressing human rights issues in West Papua, including the prior call for engagement with the UN Human Rights High Commissioner.
Mr. President, As an ocean and island nation, we congratulate our close neighbor Palau for having successfully hosted the Our Oceans conference earlier this year. We support the recent UN 2022 Oceans Conference in Lisbon and congratulate Portugal and Kenya for co-chairing this meeting.  The world must address a growing gap in eﬀective oceans management in the high seas and its neighboring coastal states.  While we welcome important progress, far greater eﬀort will be needed to conclude an ambitious instrument on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction, under the UN Law of the Sea.  While our Paciﬁc islands tuna stocks stand strong, the ﬁshing eﬀort by global actors grows.  We are proud of our sustainability benchmarks and partnerships, and small island developing states must continue to boost economic participation to match our leadership eﬀorts.
Mr. President, The United Nations must be truly universal, all embracing and all inclusive. And we must guard against leaving any nation or people outside the gate and in the cold. 4Today, we call on the UN to better welcome Taiwan and its people into our global family. How long will the UN persist in closing its doors and thereby denying access to the people of Taiwan? Taiwan is a vibrant democracy and responsible and contributing member of our global family, and the United Nations circle of unity is incomplete without Taiwan and its people.
The United Nations Secretariat too often relies on politically-motivated interpretations of Resolution 2758, when responding to opportunities for the meaningful participation of Taiwan in international bodies and the UN system.  Now, that the world is facing escalated tension in and around our islands region, we as the world cannot be silent.
With the ability for meaningful participation in the UN system, and to make greater contributions, Taiwan can better join all of us to make a collective diﬀerence.  The UN system should revert to its original policy of consideration of widely-accepted passports for basic public access to the UN itself, and make good on its goal of broader participation, including registration procedures for civil society access.  No one is left behind in the SDGs, least of all one of our important partners in tackling these goals.
Mr. President,  The United Nations is in desperate need of a UN Security Council which is truly ﬁt for purpose and which should be better shaped to the realities of today, not eight decades ago.  We strongly support better progress in achieving UN Security Council reform outcomes, and in particular support Japan’s bid to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
In closing, it is very clear to us that all the problems that our global communities are facing today from the COVID19 pandemic to the roaring inﬂations and rising energy costs, can not be solved by any single nation. Rather, we must come together as a united global family to solve them. But we can not solve these problems as long as the world is in conﬂict or in other words, we can not do it without world peace.
It reminds me of the following poem:
“If there is righteousness in the heart,
there will be beauty in the character.
If there is beauty in the character,
there will be harmony in the home.
If there is harmony in the home,
there will be order in the nation.
If there is order in the nation,
there will be peace in the world.”
Thank You and kommol tata Mr. President.5", MHL,2022

ADDRESS BY MR WAVEL RAMKALAWAN, PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
SEYCHELLES  
0 SEPTEMBER 2022  
Theme: A watershed moment: Transformative solutions to interlocking challenges   
 
Mr President of the United Nations General Assembly,  
Mr Secretary -General of  the United Nations,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
  
Seychelles congratulates you, Mr President, on your election as President  of the 
seventy -seventh session of the United  Nations General Assembly. We also 
extend our profound appreciation  to your predecessor, Mr Abdullah Shahid, 
for his leadership during the  preceding session.  
  
I wish also to express our gratitude to Secretary General Antonio Guterres, for 
his efforts to pursue a Common Agenda for the United Nations, at a time when 
faith in the multilateral system needs, more than ever, to be restored.   
  
Mr. President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,  
  
We perhaps need to be reminded that multilateralism gives each one of us the 
opportunity and the means to solve complex challenges that we cannot 
overcome on our own.  
  
Never have we faced challenges of su ch magnitude.   
 
A world in deep crisis.  
 
Climate inaction.  
 
The aftermath of the pandemic.  
 
Food insecurity.  
 
The rising costs of energy.  
 
The war in Ukraine.  
 
We have reached an inflection point. One that compels us to question the 
trajectory of our multilateral order, as the perils to our collective wellbeing are 
acute and numerous.2 
  
Faced with a multiplicity of interrelated challenges that many of us are lea st 
responsible for, but most affected by, the plight of states in vulnerable situations 
has never been more pronounced. Many of us in the developing world have had 
to revise our 200 aspirations due to lost progress.  
 
Mr. President,   
 
Economic inequity i s the biggest impediment to the realisation of the 
Sustainable Development Goals.   
 
The blueprint for a better and sustainable future requires financial resources that 
many of us simply do not have, or are unable to access, since development 
cooperation m odalities fail to consider vulnerability as a barrier to durable 
development.  
 
Time and again, SIDS have consistently reiterated the call for a globally -
accepted vulnerability assessment put forward in 1992 by the United Nations 
Conference on Environment and Development.  
 
Our island nations have experienced the greatest economic loss from the 
pandemic, with economic contractions averaging 7 percent. Yet very few of us 
were able to access the meagre 6 percent of COVID -19 funding allocated to 
developing cou ntries.   
 
We cannot continue to rely on temporary solutions to address the systemic 
faults within the existing development cooperation mechanisms. If this is to be a 
watershed moment, we must put into practice real solutions that focus on 
addressing vulne rabilities and building resilience to ensure socio -economic 
sustainability. We need the international financial institutions and multilateral 
development banks to look beyond the Gross National Income benchmark.   
 
There is broad consensus that a Multidime nsional Vulnerability Index (MVI) 
offers a specific approach that will complement and improve the efficacy of 
development cooperation, permitting countries in vulnerable situations to access 
concessional financing and address their needs.  
 
I therefore wel come the Interim report of the High -Level Panel on the MVI, and 
hope that progress on universally -accepted and inclusive indicators that capture 
vulnerabilities of all developing states can be accelerated ahead of the 2023 
deadline.   
 
Mr President,3 
 The current food and energy crisis, exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine,  
poses a threat to sustainable growth globally, necessitating integrated systemic 
responses.  
 
The challenge for us in Africa is how to guarantee that trade contributes 
meaningfully to food security.  
 
In this regard, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has a vital 
role to play by stimulating intra -trade amongst ourselves by ensuring th at we 
redistribute food produced from regions with a surplus to regions facing 
deficits.  
 
The solutions to our food security can be achievable. We firmly believe that 
harnessing the potential of the blue economy by tapping into fisheries and 
aquaculture r esources can be a viable option to address food and nutrition 
insecurity that prevails at the moment.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Food and energy security must be apprehended within the context of climate 
change.  
 
We are at the cusp of an ecological collapse spurr ed by climate change, 
pollution, and biodiversity loss, largely instigated by irresponsible human 
activities and unfettered emissions.   
 
A situation which greatly threatens the inalienable right of all humans to a 
healthy environment.  
 
The IPCC reports h ave made clear that the window of opportunity to effectively 
address climate change is rapidly closing, with dire consequences for humanity 
and ecosystems. Failing to act decisively and urgently now, will lead to untold 
costs. With those least responsible for this calamity having to bear the heaviest 
price.   
 
As floods, heatwaves and fires in the western world dominate the news and our 
social media feeds, let us not neglect nor forget that the impact of slow onset 
events like sea -level rise pose an existen tial threat to SIDS.  
 
We need bold actions not unfulfilled promises and pledges.  
 
In defining this watershed moment, individual interests must converge into 
collective benefits.4 
 And we must also confront the gross injustice of having citizens of states  least 
responsible for the unravelling climate -induced disaster pay for the loss and 
damage caused by others.  
 
Even as we bear the impact of climate change, our environment is suffering 
immensely from the consequences of pollution. Seychelles can attest t o this 
fact, as our shores and sea have become encumbered by plastic waste.   
 
I am nonetheless heartened that a historical agreement to establish an 
Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee with the mandate to forge an 
international legally -binding agreeme nt to end plastic pollution was achieved at 
UNEA -.2.  
 
Hopefully, this will raise ambitions in other areas of environmental protection, 
including in the protection of biodiversity.  
 
The pressure that human activities are exerting on biodiversity are tipping the 
scale towards mass extinction across the globe.  
 
Therefore, the UN Conference on Biodiversity (COP15) will be critical for the 
post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. If the world is to achieve the 
Framework’s ambitious targets, ensure that the SDGs are met and tackle the 
interrelated planetary crisis we must invest in the means of the Framework’s 
implementation.   
 
Mr. President,  
 
Related to this is the issue of the oceans which surround us.  
 
Healthy oceans are critical to life on Earth.  
 
As a foremost proponent of the Blue Economy paradigm, Seychelles has taken 
bold steps to sustainably harness our ocean for the benefit of our pe ople.  
 
By implementing our Marine Spatial plan, we have not only set aside 30 percent 
of our Economic Exclusive Zone for protection and sustainable use, but also 
helped consolidate progress towards our commitments under the UNFCCC and 
Paris Agreement, as well as the SDGs and CBD.   
 
The MSP exemplifies how climate action, ocean conservation, sustainable 
development and building resilience can be achieved by a SIDS with immutable 
special circumstances in an integrated manner.5 
 Building on this, Seychelles has committed to protect at least 50 percent of its 
seagrass ecosystems by 2025, and 100 percent by 2030, greatly contributing to 
ecosystem preservation and carbon sequestration.  
 
We call on other littoral and oceanic states to be as bold in their ocean 
commitments.  
 
As we progress in the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable 
Development, it is imperative that we invest in science best approaches and 
forge strong partnerships needed to achieve a better understanding and 
protection of the ocean.  
 
Beyond the preservation of our natural environment, such holistic measures can 
be applied to the myriad of interlocking challenges that we are facing as a 
global community. It will take our combined will, conclusive action, and 
uncompromising respect for the founding principles of the United Nations to 
secure a better future for all.   
 
Mr President,  
 
Last but of no less importance is the situation in Ukraine. The Ukraine -Russia 
conflict is of great concern to us. It poses a grave threat to global security and 
world peace, with serious ramifications for the entire community of nations.   
 
My country’s s tance on the peaceful resolution of conflicts through dialogue 
and diplomacy is universally recognised.   
 
In this regard, the Republic of Seychelles strongly supports the call of the Chair 
of the African Union and the Chairperson of the African Union Comm ission 
urging the parties concerned to establish an immediate ceasefire and to resume 
negotiations in order to preserve the world from the consequences of planetary 
conflict and to find a permanent and mutually acceptable solution to the 
conflict.  
 
Mr Pre sident,  
 
We must find common ground for the sake of humanity and our planet.   
 
In attempting to utilise this critical moment in history as a turning point to bring 
about real positive change, the choice is clearly with every one of us to decide 
whether o ur actions will lead to shared prosperity or mutual destruction.  
 
Let us be reminded of our moral responsibility as world leaders to take bold and 
decisive steps that will truly bring about transformative solutions.6 
 We share only one planet, and our fat es are indivisible.  
 
Let us secure a better future together.  
 
I thank you.", SYC,2022

Speech by the President of the Republic of Poland at the 
77th session of the UN General Assembly 
20 September 2022 
 
Honorable Mr. Secretary General,  
Your Excellency, Distinguished Mr. President,  
Excellencies, Distinguished Heads of States and Nations,   
Esteemed Delegates ,  
 
One year ago, I was delivering my speech at this very place as a president of a country 
of 38 million people. Today, I am standing on the rostrum with the awareness that Poland may 
be inhabited today by up to 41 million people, according to various statistics. The additional 
three millions of people are predominantly refugees from Ukraine. Some of them are our 
permanent guests while others travel between Poland and Ukraine. 
The war has been going on for seven months, and Russia is not limiting itself to fighting 
the Ukrainian army, with whom they are losing. It is killing civilians or forcibly relocating them 
to its territory. It is destroying cities, monuments, schools, kindergartens, hospitals. It destroys 
agricultural crops and devastates the environment. It destroys literally everything it cannot seize 
or loot. It even threatens to cause a nuclear catastrophe. 
The decision to wage this war was made by people prompted by imperial sentiment 
and colonial, nationalist hubris - exalting their own people and denying the right to self-
determination to their sovereign neighbors. They managed to obsess the nation of one of the 
UN's founding states with this thought. A nation that had a chance to protest against the 
insanity of its leaders. Unfortunately, only a few, those most courageous, stood up against this 
war. 
Honorable Secretary General! 
Ladies and Gentlemen! 
This war, like all other conflicts going on in the world today, must be lost by the 
aggressor, and in this case it is the Russian state. More than that: the aggressor has already lost 
it failing to subdue a free nation, to break its spirit, to disperse its army. Today it has against it 
not the Ukrainian state itself, but a nation of many millions, the vast majority of whom do not 
 want any negotiations with the invader until he withdraws his forces from Ukraine. It is at odds 
with a large part of the nations of the world, who have spoken their minds very clearly, also in 
the resolutions adopted in this fold. It has against it Poland whom, and I'm saying this here and 
now, Ukraine may count on. 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen! 
 I was one of those politicians who, even before the war, believed that Ukraine 
would successfully defend itself. Today I am convinced that it will prevail, that the refugees 
will return, that Ukraine will be rebuilt, that its internationally recognized borders will be 
restored. My country, Poland, joining forces with its Allies, will do its utmost to make this 
happen. 
But there are other facets to this war: it has economic repercussions in many areas. A 
parallel war unleashed by Russia, the war against our common principles and values, against 
all of humanity. And I also want to talk about humanity today, because I see representatives of 
many familiar countries from Africa, the Middle East and Asia in this hall, the countries whose 
leaders I spoke with just before or during the war. 
 This is not a regional conflict: it is a stoke of global fire, this war will bear 
on our countries and yours. Unless it has already happened. 
 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen , 
One of the most dramatic effects of the Russian aggression is the food crisis and the 
specter of famine looming over large parts of the world. I have had lengthy discussions on the 
subject during my recent journey to countries of West Africa: Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire and 
Senegal. In all those countries I have spoken with their leaders about food security and potential 
impacts of further restrictions on exports of grain and fertilizers from Ukraine and Russia. The 
topic featured also in previous discussions we had together with fellow presidents from Central 
and Eastern Europe as we spoke with the leaders from Africa, Middle East and Asia.  
I vividly recall a late-night consultation in Rzeszow we had together with UN Secretary 
General who was on his way to Ukraine to address food-related problems there. Thank you, Sir,  
for your zeal, commitment, for your resolve and courage. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
From the very beginning of the invasion, Russia has been deliberately and cynically 
destroying new crops and farming equipment, and the invasion itself has drastically reduced 
Ukrainian harvests. The data we have obtained makes it clear: Russia has seized farmland 
 representing 22% of all agricultural land in Ukraine. One-fifth of the land that is the breadbasket 
of many non-European countries; the land which produces nearly 30% of winter crops has failed 
to produce any crops this season or its harvest has been looted. Speaking in this fold, I do not 
need to recall that Ukraine is one of the most important food producers in the world. 
Conservative estimates indicate that this year alone Ukraine's  harvest will be 35% 
smaller in the aftermath of war. I emphasize, THIRTY-FIVE percent. 
More than one-third of what has been the granary of large parts of the world has been 
eliminated by Russian aggression. Who will suffer from this? Those who are most in need. It is 
an economic weapon, it is weaponization of food hitting the hardest Africa and the Middle East. 
I have been in politics long enough not to be naïve on that count: this is a deliberate policy.  in 
this regard: this is a deliberate policy. It is estimated that in the aftermath of war in Ukraine, 
the number of people suffering from chronic hunger this year will increase by about 47 
million people.  
Again: especially in Africa and the Middle East. 
 
Excellencies, 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
As an international community, we are obliged to prevent anyone in the 21st century 
from knowingly and cynically causing artificial famine in the name of achieving their political 
goals, the way Stalin did back in the 1930’s. In this context, it is of key importance that on July 
22, in Istanbul, Russia and Ukraine signed separate agreements with Turkey and the UN - aimed 
at unblocking the sea route through the Black Sea for the export of millions of tons of Ukrainian 
grain.  
Personally, I would like to acknowledge once again the significant role played by the 
United Nations Secretary General in the conclusion of this accord.   
Now we all have to guard the parties' compliance with the agreements and their 
commitments. I am all the more concerned by the ever more frequent statements from the 
Russian side, undermining the accord, as well as by acts deserving to be condemned in the 
strongest terms - such as the shelling of the Odessa seaport by the Russian army, which occurred 
less than 24 hours of the signing of the documents. As an international community, we must 
immediately respond to such incidents by imposing further sanctions and providing more aid 
packages to Ukraine which is defending itself.  
For my part, I would like to assure you that Poland, together with its European Union 
partners, remains steadfastly committed to facilitating Ukrainian grain exports, also by land. 
We will go to great lengths to make sure those consignments reach those who are most in need. 
  
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
Honorable Delegates, 
In the face of Russia's unlawful actions, we should learn a lesson for the future. We 
should also keep in mind the provisions of the law and the possibility of holding 
perpetrators accountable.   
A number of regulations exists in international law on the protection of food resources 
and the natural environment during conflicts.  Among others, one can cite the provisions of 
Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which 
recognizes the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, and in which states 
pledged to distribute the world's food supplies equitably.  
In addition, Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions relating to the Protection of Victims 
of International Armed Conflicts (June 8, 1977), in Article 54, prohibits, among other things, 
attacking, destroying, removing, or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of 
the civilian population, such as foodstuffs and agricultural zones. In turn, Article 55 of the 
Protocol obliges states to protect the natural environment from damage during hostilities.  
That Russia is deliberately destroying Ukraine's agriculture in breach of international 
law is probably no great surprise to anyone here. But in the face of a barbaric war, are 
international legal regulations a sufficient response to the enormity of the damage to the 
environment and the world's food supply? I have strong doubts about this. 
It is in this context that I see the need to develop penalization mechanisms to able in the 
future to bring to justice the perpetrators responsible for violating international law. Those who 
knowingly destroy crops in the “breadbasket of the world” must know that they will be 
pursued to be prosecuted as long as they live! 
I would like from this place to pledge our support to all existing and new initiatives so 
that those who deprive millions of people of their right to food and destroy the environment 
will no longer go unpunished. Poland wants to actively participate in their work. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
Honorable Delegates, 
The Russian aggression on Ukraine constitutes no less than an aggression against the 
whole world. Each aggression requires a multidimensional international response, with 
determination and without hesitation. It is necessary to step-up the pressure on Russia and its 
accomplice: Lukashenka’s regime in Belarus. Advisability of continuing cooperation with those 
 governments should be reassessed, also by international organizations. There is no more room 
for ""business as usual .""  
I say this as a man who has been to Ukraine three times since the beginning of the war 
and who left Ukraine in a matter of hours before the aggression. 
I say this as a leader of the state who borders were crossed by almost 6 million Ukrainian 
refugees.  
Our children go to schools together with Ukrainian children. 
Our citizens have taken to their homes hundreds of thousands refugees: yes, not even a 
single refugee camp needed to be set up.  
Every Polish man and every Polish woman is familiar with the situation in Ukraine. 
We really cannot remain silent. 
Mr. President, Distinguished Members of Delegations,  
 
We must not forget those who are suffering. Let us remember that six months of Russian 
aggression in Ukraine has brought the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War 
II. I appeal for an increase in aid to the Ukrainian civilian population, whose humanitarian needs 
are far greater than the funds currently being provided. Winter is approaching, which 
aggravated by the war and energy prices - will be the hardest winter in years. As humanity, we 
have no right to turn our backs on those most in need. We mustn’t show any ""war fatigue"".  
We should work together on such a roadmap for economic and social development to 
give people hope that the world can be a better and more supportive place to live; in spite of 
being so scarred today by wars, the effects of pandemics and natural disasters. Poland wants to 
co-create such a program including here at the UN, for example as part of the work of the 
Economic and Social Council. 
Ladies and Gentlemen! 
Still, I owe a few words of truth to us – the leaders of the rich North, or – as others might 
like to put it - of the West.  
It is very positive that we have risen to the challenge on the issue of Ukraine, that we 
have preserved our unity and rallied to support the victim, and not the aggressor. But let's not 
become complacent. My recent visit to Africa made me even more aware of something I had 
previously thought about for a long time myself. 
 Were we equally resolute during the tragedies of Syria, Libya, Yemen? Did we not 
return to business as usual after two great tragedies of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the 
wars in the Horn of Africa, and while condemning the invasion of Ukraine, do we give equal 
weight to fighting mercenaries who seek to destabilize the Sahel and threaten many other states 
in Africa?  
This is how I see the lesson learnt from this war: if the United Nations is truly to be 
united, every response to violations of international law should be identical - decisive and 
principled. Because the world is a system of communicating vessels. Today the victim is 
Ukraine, but if Russian imperialism succeeds - then tomorrow it could be any country in the 
world. And crops will be plundered and civilians turned out of doors in yet another country.  
We must not allow this to happen! 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Poland's position in the face of any war is clear: we recognize every state within its 
internationally recognized borders and we demand respect for their inviolability. Today it`s 
Ukraine, tomorrow anyone of us.  
And there is no hiding it: Russia owes Ukraine war reparations, which it will have to 
pay back. There is no justice without reparations. This applies to any country plundering another 
country. It applies today, but it also applies to unsettled issues from the past. I say this as the 
Polish President. And I think you can well understand why I am saying this. 
Therefore, Poland shall not cease its efforts aimed at holding Russia accountable for its 
violations of international law, both at the state-level as well as on the individual one.  
We commend the work of the International Law Commission leading to the drafting of 
the Convention on the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity. 
We will use all our powers and capabilities to ensure that the culprits are tried and 
punished. We are already cooperating with the International Criminal Court and the 
International Court of Justice to find the most effective ways to identify and prosecute the 
perpetrators. 
 
Distinguished Mr. President,  
Ladies and Gentlemen. 
 On many occasions in its history, has the free world been facing  partition wars caused 
by enemies of freedom, possessed by sick ambitions or the desire for total domination. From 
the genocidaires of the most ancient times to Adolf Hitler, the essence of these wars has not 
changed in any way. It always begins with a cult of strength and a belief in one's superiority 
over another human being. 
However, man always pitched oneself against the aggressor and genocidaire. A free 
man. Aggression stirs in people the will to resist, courage, fortitude, solidarity and the desire 
to support the victims of injustice. And thus we continue to exist as humanity. I think this is an 
obligation derived not only from the harsh laws of politics. It lies at the very foundation of 
human nature, for, as Pericles put it in his famous Athenian funeral oration: ""happiness is the 
fruit of freedom and freedom - of valor"".  A man and a nation is able to pay any price for 
freedom and fight for it to the very end. Man rebels against slavery, colonialism, oppression, 
because it is his nature. 
For months, Ukraine has been exemplifying to us almost unbelievable valor. Therefore, 
in conclusion, I call on all of you from this place: let us not be indifferent to the heroism and 
full determination of the struggle for freedom. Let us never show indifference to any nation that 
defends itself against tyranny and contempt for humanity. For by doing so, it always defends 
all of humanity against such tyranny and contempt. 
The vision of a world in which only naked power wins is not only wrong and immoral, 
but can lead to a conflagration engulfing the entire world. I am convinced that on this occasion 
it is no different. And I say this in the forum of an organization that was formed in the wake of 
the greatest of such conflagrations. It was not without reason that in 1945 the leaders of our 
countries - the founding members of the UN - declared their intent to build a world based on 
dialogue, opposing the use of naked force. 
Let us not forget this legacy. Let us not allow any tragedies to happen in the future, 
similar to those we experienced in the 20th century!", POL,2022
 JPN_77_2022,"  (Provisional Translation) Address by Prime Minister Kishida at the Seventy-Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly  Mr. /Mme. President, Excellencies,  We stand at a historic watershed moment.  Seventy-seven years have passed since the establishment of the United Nations, yet we are still witnessing the devastation in Ukraine and around the world. What would the founders of the United Nations, who were determined to not repeat the scourge of the World Wars, think if they saw the challenges to the international order that we are facing?   We have all gathered here at this Assembly because we stand with the fundamental vision and principles of the UN Charter. The realization of an international community where all Member States unite to maintain peace and security, and where all people can enjoy the economic and social development – isn’t this what we are aiming for?  It is an imperative to maintain the international order where the rule of law is firmly established. The United Nations has been playing a central role in the development of such an international order.   However, we see today its foundations being gravely shaken. Russia's aggression against Ukraine is an act that tramples on the vision and principles of the UN Charter. What is crucial is for any and all countries to be under the rule of law – not the rule by force, which we absolutely cannot allow.  The United Nations does not exist solely for the benefit of the great powers. The United Nations exists for the entire international community, founded on the principle of the sovereign equality of all Member States. It exists to fulfill the claims of not just the powerful and the loud states but also of the voices that are often unheard but are equally legitimate.   Especially at a time when the existing international order is being tested around the world, now is the time to return to the vision and principles of the UN Charter and mobilize our strength and wisdom to ensure an international order based on the rule of law. To achieve this, we must reform the United Nations and strengthen its functions. Former Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, who was killed in the line of duty while attempting to mediate a ceasefire amid the Congo Crisis, said, ""It is our responsibility to remedy any flaws there may be in [the institutions of the UN].” In order to realize a world that the UN Charter aspires to, we must tackle head-on the strengthening of the UN’s functions.   To demonstrate Japan's strong commitment to the United Nations as well as to multilateralism, I hereby declare Japan's determination to realize the vision of the United Nations. They are,   First, the reform of the United Nations, including the Security Council, to return to the vision and principles of the UN Charter, with the strengthening of the UN’s own functions, including disarmament and non-proliferation.   Second, the realization of a United Nations that promotes the rule of law in the international community.  Third, the promotion of efforts based on the concept of human security in the new era.   Mr. /Mme. President, Excellencies,   We must face the fact that the credibility of the United Nations is at stake due  to the aggression against Ukraine by Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council. We, the Member States of the UN, must act to restore this Organization’s credibility.   Frequently, debates about the dysfunctionality of the Security Council have been pointed out. We have debated about this issue for almost over thirty years. But what is truly needed now is not a discussion for the sake of discussion, but actions toward reform. Even amongst the Permanent Member States of the Security Council, there are some countries that have shown a willingness to embrace reform. But there can be ""No reform without negotiation.""  The various positions cannot be compromised or converge without any negotiation. The time has come to start text-based negotiations to reform the Security Council. The Summit of the Future in 2024 is an excellent opportunity to broadly review the nature of the UN. By all means, let us gather a wide range of wisdom, including from experts, and build momentum.  Faced with the crisis of the international order caused by Russia’s aggression, the General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning Russia in the strongest terms with an overwhelming majority. At that time, the UN was a beacon in the dark night, clearly indicating the direction in which the international community should go. The General Assembly proved to be the sole universal organ that represents all Member States, pointing us in the direction of the international community's just cause.   Japan is determined not only to reform the Security Council, but also to work earnestly to further revitalize the General Assembly and to push the UN so it can pursue an even greater role in the maintenance of peace and security. Japan will also continue to support the Secretary-General as he oversees the activities of this Organization.   Threatening the use of nuclear weapons, as Russia has done, let alone the actual use of nuclear weapons, is a serious threat to the peace and security of the international community, and is absolutely unacceptable.   As a prime minister from Hiroshima, I am immensely dedicated to the realization of a world without nuclear weapons driven by the sentiments from the hibakusha. Last month, the sole opposition by Russia blocked the unity and concerted efforts by the international community to reach consensus on an outcome document that would maintain and strengthen the NPT regime, which is the cornerstone of the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime.    This caused me great dismay, just as it did for the overwhelming majority of the Member States. I, however, refuse to relent. Because we are only one country away from adopting the draft final outcome document by consensus. I believe this document represents a new foundation for the international community to proceed with realistic engagements on nuclear disarmament in the future. As the only nation to have ever suffered atomic bombings during war, Japan has a unique historic role and we renew our resolve to realize “a world without nuclear weapons.” We will continue to make realistic efforts to achieve this goal. We must ensure that Nagasaki remains the last place to suffer an atomic bombing.  This is the 20th year since the Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration which was signed by Prime Minister Koizumi and Chairman of the National Defense Commission Kim Jong-il. Japan's policy remains unchanged. Japan seeks to normalize its relationship with North Korea, in accordance with the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration, through comprehensively resolving the outstanding issues of concern such as the abductions, nuclear and missile issues, as well as settlement of the unfortunate past. Japan is prepared to engage in dialogue on matters of mutual concern. I am determined to meet with President Kim Jong-un without any conditions and will miss no opportunity to take actions with all my dedication.   Japan has also made long-term contributions in the field of peacebuilding. Japan first participated in a full-scale peacekeeping mission in Cambodia in 1992.  Thirty years later, many Cambodian personnel wearing blue helmets are protecting the peace and future of places such as Mali, Central African Republic, and Lebanon. Then Lieutenant Colonel Teav Chanrithy was one of those who was deployed to Lebanon after Japan's peacekeeping training. Since then, he has been active as a peacebuilder, mentoring younger generations at the PKO training center for the Cambodian Armed Forces.  The torch of peace created through Japan's contributions to peacekeeping operations will be borne beyond generations and across borders. Japan supports it.  Mr. /Mme. President, Excellencies,   Next, Japan is fully committed to the realization of a United Nations that promotes the rule of law in the international community.  The rule of law is not reserved for one particular State or region. We need to remind ourselves that the rule of law is especially important for vulnerable nations.   Strengthening the rule of law based on international law will, in the long run, benefit all States and lead to sustainable growth and sound development of the international community.   Based on this belief, Japan has been playing an active role in various fields in cooperation with other countries, including efforts towards the realization of a ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific.""  In 1970, overcoming serious divisions among Member States at the time and with persistent dialogue, the General Assembly adopted the “Friendly Relations Declaration.” This Declaration, the fruit of our predecessors' wisdom, serves as a foundation from which the basic principles for the promotion of the rule of law are drawn.   The following basic principles for States emerge from this declaration: first, break away from ""rule by force"" and pursue ""rule of law"" through observing international law in good faith; second, in this regard, do not allow any attempts to change the status quo of territories and areas by force or coercion; and third, to cooperate with one another against serious violations of the principles of the UN Charter.  We are convinced that these basic principles serve as the basis to hold an increasingly divided international community together while ensuring respect for human rights and achieving sustainable development.   From next January, Japan will serve as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. By listening not only to the big voices but also being attentive to the small voices, we intend to take action to strengthen the rule of law in the international community.   Mr. /Mme. President, Excellencies,  Japan will strengthen efforts based on the concept of human security in the new era.  People deserve to enjoy a high-quality life, free from anxiety and fear. The concept of human security has not changed, but now, we are standing at a historical watershed moment, and facing a new challenge. Today, in addition to global pandemics, the use of force and coercion against other countries, food and energy insecurity, inflation and climate change are all interconnected and threaten the safety of people now more than ever, further exacerbating poverty and disease.    The Sustainable Development Goals aim for a society in which no one is left behind, and their achievement requires the realization of human security in the new area. In doing so, the key is to enhance the resilience of individuals,  societies, and nations to cope with the changes and challenges specific to our times.    The Adjumani District in Uganda is facing difficult and complicated issues such as the increasing influx of refugees from neighboring countries, and rising costs due to the situation in Ukraine, which is just one example of the difficult and complex challenges that the world is facing today.  Moini Fred, an administrator from Adjumani, learned through JICA training, how to incorporate the views of both refugees and his compatriots in running his District. Despite its own economic difficulties, Adjumani District continues to provide administrative services as well as support to refugees, and Mr. Fred is working hard to build a cohesive community free of ethnicity- or nationality-based tensions.  With a shaking international order and people’s anxiety growing, Japan will work with the United Nations to realize human security in the new era, including initiatives through the UN Trust Fund for Human Security. In addition, Japan will also continue to invest generously in people.  At TICAD 8 (the 8th Tokyo International Conference on African Development) in August this year, I announced the investment of US$30 billion in Africa as the sum of public and private financial contributions over the next three years, with an emphasis on ""investment in people."" Japan will also focus on human resource development and capacity-building in other parts of the world. Based on my conviction that education is the foundation of peace, I will assume the position as an “Education Champion” and I will promote cooperation through human resource development based on the outcome of the UN Transforming Education Summit.  The COVID-19 pandemic has also illustrated the importance of human health and efforts to protect people from diseases. Japan has provided a total of approximately US$5 billion to support the COVID-19 response, including  vaccine-related assistance through COV AX and other programs. Japan has also decided to contribute US$1.08 billion to the Global Fund over the next three years. Japan will continue to take a leading role in strengthening the global health architecture and achieving universal health coverage (UHC) in the post-COVID-19 era, toward the G7 Summit that I will chair next year.  Japan is also steadily contributing to the creation of a world where people can enjoy a high quality life in a safe environment. Our emergency assistance and support to strengthen the resilience of food systems to ensure food security, as well as our role in the development of international standards and norms in the field of information and telecommunications through the efforts at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and other organizations, are just a few examples. In order to promote these efforts, Japan will also revise its “Development Cooperation Charter,” which articulates the basic policy of our development cooperation policies.  I support Secretary-General Guterres’s leadership in presenting ""Our Common Agenda"" as a response to the current and future challenges facing the international community. As history experiences this dramatic change, Japan will continue to support suffering people around the world under the concept of the human security in the new era. Japan will work together with the UN and other Member States towards the maintenance of peace and stability underpinned by an international order based on the rule of law.  Mr. /Mme. President, Excellencies,  It is precisely because we stand at a watershed moment in history that Japan continues to have strong expectations for the United Nations. Times change, but one thing remains the same: the vision and the principles of the UN. With this conviction, I am determined to work with everyone to strengthen the UN.  Thank you very much for your kind attention.", JPN,2022
 DEU_77_2022,"Speech  by Olaf Scholz , Chancellor  
Federal  Republic  of Germany  
 
77th general  debate   
of the United  Nations  General  Assembly 
 
New York,  20 September  2022  
 
 
It is with humility and deep respect that I am addressing you today – both as the newly elected 
Chancellor of Germany and as a proud delegate to our United Nations.  
My country and the United Nations are indivisibly linked. 
Today’s democratic and reunited Germany owes its role on the world stage to you, our 
international friends and Partners.  
You placed your trust in us to become and to remain a peace -loving member of the international 
community. 
We know that we owe our freedom, our stability and our prosperity to an international order with 
the United Nations at its core.  
Therefore, my country ’s commitment to this organisation and its noble goals  – peace, 
development and equal rights and dignity for every human being – will never wane.  
Unfortunately, I’m expressing this commitment at a time during which we’re getting further away from these noble Goals.  
After decades during which we overcame walls and blocs  – a time in which we marked the fall 
of the Iron Curtain and German reunification –  
after the technological revolution of the internet and the digital transformation, which have made us more interconnected than ever before, we are now facing a new fragmentation of the world.  
New wars and conflicts have emerged. Major global crises are piling up before us and are combining and reinforcing one another.Some have even seen this as a harbinger of a world without rules. 
It’s true that the risks to our global order are real.  
And yet I  don’t hold with the image of a world without rules  – for two reasons:  
Firstly, our world has clear rules.  
Rules that we, the United Nations, created together. 
This Char ter promises all of us freedom and peaceful coexistence.  
This Charter is our collective rejection of a world without rules. 
Our problem isn’t the absence of rules. Our problem is the lack of willingness to abide by and 
enforce them.  
But the image of a worl d without rules leads us astray for a second reason.  
If we don’t defend, further develop and strengthen our global order together, then it isn’t chaos 
without rules that we face,  
but a world in which the rules are made by those who can dictate them to us by dint of their military, economic or political power.  
The alternative to a rules -based world isn’t anarchy, but the dominion of the strong over the 
weak.  
The vast majority of us cannot be indifferent to whether the rule of power or the power of rules wins the day.  
The key question that we as an international community face is this: should we  stand helplessly 
by and watch as some seek to cast us back into a global order in which war is a common instrument of politics;  
in which independent nations have to submit to their stronger neighbours or their colonial masters;  
in which prosperity and hum an rights are a privilege of the lucky few?Or will we manage to stand together and ensure that the  multipolar  world of the 21st century 
remains a multilateral world?  
My answer, as a German and a European is this: we  have  to manage this.  
And we  will manage this if we take  three fundamental  principles  to heart.  
Firstly,  the international order doesn’t happen by itself. If we do nothing, then this Charter is but 
a piece of paper.  
This Charter calls on all of us to uphold its purposes and principles.  
We mustn’t stand idly by when a major nuclear power armed to the teeth – a founding member 
of the United Nations and a permanent member of the  UN Security Council no less  – seeks to 
shift borders through the use of violence.  
There is no justifi cation whatsoever for Russia’s war of occupation against  Ukraine . 
President Putin is waging this war with one single objective: to seize Ukraine. 
Self-determination and political independence do not count for him. 
There is only one word for this. This is i mperialism plain and simple!  
The return of imperialism is not only a disaster for Europe.  
It is also a disaster for our global peaceful order, which is the antithesis of imperialism and neo-
colonialism.  
That’s why it was so important that, here in this room, 141 countries categorically condemned Russia’s war of occupation. 
But that alone isn’t enough!  
If we want this war to end, then we cannot be indifferent to how  it Ends. 
Putin will only give up his war and his imperialist ambitions if he realises that he  cannot win.  
In so doing, he isn’t just destroying Ukraine but is also ruining his own Country. 
This is why we will not accept a peace dictated by Russia – and we will not accept any sham 
referendums either.  
This is why Ukraine must be able to defend itsel f against Russia’s Invasion. 
We’re supporting Ukraine with all our might  – financially, economically, with humanitarian 
assistance, and also with weapons.  
Together with our partners around the world, we have imposed tough economic sanctions on the 
Russian leadership and Russia’s economy.This is how we are making good on a promise that each and every of our countries made when 
joining the United Nations, namely to join forces  ”to maintain international  peace and security “. 
There’s one more thing tha t I would like to add, which is that not  one sack of grain has been held 
back on account of these sanctions. Russia alone has prevented Ukrainian grain ships from putting out to sea, bombing ports and destroying agricultural Enterprises.  
“Where hunger  prevails  there can  be no peace ”. 
My predecessor, Nobel Peace Prize winner Willy  Brandt, said this when he addressed this 
Assembly, as the first Federal Chancellor to do so, in 1973. 
Today, we are witnessing that this sentence also works the other way around. 
Those who want there to be no hunger must ensure that Putin’s war does not prevail  – this war, 
which even in countries far away from Russia is leading to rising prices, energy scarcity and 
famine.  
The fact that grain exports have been made possible once aga in thanks to the mediation efforts of 
Secretary -General Guterres and Turkey deserves great respect.  
Germany is also supporting Ukraine with the export of Food.  
And we will stand by Ukraine when it comes to shouldering the enormous costs for rebuilding the Country. 
At an international expert conference, which I’m hosting with the President of the European 
Commission in Berlin on 25 October, we will, together with supporters of Ukraine from all 
around the world, think about how we can manage this Herculean Ta sk. 
Our message is this: we stand firmly at the side of those under attack.  
For the protection of the lives and the freedom of the Ukrainians.  
And for the protection of our international order.  
The second  principle  for preserving this order is as follows: all of us will be judged against the 
obligations that we have jointly entered into. Responsibility always begins at home. 
Take climate change, for example, which is the biggest challenge of our Generation.We, the industrialised countries and major emitter s of greenhouse gases, have a very special 
responsibility here.  
It was with this in mind that we reiterated our intention at the G7  Summit in Germany in June to 
forge ahead in order to achieve the 1.5 degree target.  
Not in spite  of the war and the energy c risis, but precisely  because  climate neutrality also leads 
to greater energy security.  
We stand by our pledges to support emerging economies and developing countries in their efforts 
to reduce emissions and to adapt to climate change  – with new just energy transition 
partnerships, for example. 
And we will not abandon the countries that are struggling the most in the face of loss and 
damage as a result of climate Change.  
By the time of the Climate Change Conference in Egypt, therefore, we want to establish a  global 
shield against climate risks.  
Our yardstick must be the obligations that we have entered into. 
Nowhere does this insight seem more obvious to me than in the protection of human Rights. 
Because they reflect the deepest need of each and every one of us to live our lives in freedom, 
unharmed and in dignity. 
This lies at the heart of what makes us humans who we are and what we have in common  – no 
matter where we come from, no matter what we believe, no matter who we love. I tell you this with the history of my country in mind. 
Germany, which betrayed all civilised values with the murder of six million Jews, an act that is 
without parallel, is aware of just how fragile our civilisation is.  
And, at the same time, we have an obligation to respect and to defend human rights at all times 
and in all places.  
My country is the second -biggest donor to the  UN system and also the second -biggest donor of 
humanitarian assistance.  
We have taken in millions of refugees here in Germany in recent years  – from the Middle East, 
Africa, Afghanistan and, most recently, from Ukraine.This is something we are proud of.  
But we also have to pay heed and take action where hundreds of thousands are made to endure 
sufferi ng, tyranny and torture in prison camps or jails  – in North Korea, Syria, Iran or Belarus.  
We must pay heed and take action when the Taliban deprive women and girls in Afghanistan of their most basic Rights.  
And we must pay heed and take action when Russia  commits war crimes in Mariupol, Bucha and 
Irpin.  
We will bring the murderers to justice.  
We are doing everything in our power to support the International Criminal Court and the Independent International Committee of Inquiry established by the Human Right s Council.  
Bolstering our common institutions  – that is what especially those who bear particular 
responsibility for our order in the world by dint of their strength and their influence should have an interest in.  
The former High Commissioner for Human Rights briefed us about the situation of the Uighurs in Xinjiang a few weeks ago. 
China should implement the High Commissioner’s recommendations.  
That would be a sign of sovereignty and strength and a guarantee of change for the better.  
A third  principle  must  be taken into consideration if we are to preserve the international order.  
We must adapt our rules and institutions to the reality of the 21st century.  
Far too often, these rules and institutions reflect the world of  30, 50 or 70 years ago.  
That also goes  for the United Nations Security Council. 
Germany has, for many years, been committed to its reform and expansion, first and foremost to 
include the countries of the Global South. 
Germany is also prepared to assume greater responsibility – as a permanent m ember and initially 
as a non -permanent seat in 2027/28. 
I kindly ask you to support our candidacy – the candidacy of a country that respects the 
principles of the United Nations and which offers and seeks cooperation.It is, to my mind, entirely natural th at the up -and-coming, dynamic countries and regions of Asia, 
Africa and southern America must be given a stronger political voice on the world stage.  
That’s in all of our interests  
as it gives rise to joint responsibility and greater acceptance for our decisions.  
Nationalism and isolation will not solve the challenges of our age.  
More  cooperation, more  partnership and more  involvement is the only reasonable response, 
whether for the fight against climate change or global health risks, inflation and disrupted supply 
chains or our approach to displacement and Migration. I say this with profound conviction. 
The insight that openness and cooperation safeguard peace and prosperity has made the past decades the happiest in the history of my country so far.  
As this year’s G7  President, it is therefore a key priority for me to promote a new form of 
cooperation with the countries of the Global South – 
cooperation that not only claims to take place on a level playing field, but one on which actors 
genuinely see eye to eye.  
Especially since this level playing field has existed  de facto  for a long time, if we consider the 
growing political, economic and demographic clout of Asia, Africa and southern America.  
From the outset, we coordinated our objectives very closely w ith Indonesia as the holder of the 
G20 Presidency.  
We have involved the countries holding the Chairmanship of the African Union and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in our discussions as the  G7, as well as 
India and South Africa.  
This g ave rise to new models of global cooperation, which have one thing in common, namely 
the fact that they are characterised by joint responsibility and mutual solidarity. 
We’re fighting the hunger crisis with a new Alliance for Global Food Security, and I  would like 
to invite you all to join this Alliance.  
We have launched a Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment in order, together, to 
mobilise 600 billion dollars for public and private infrastructure investments around the world over the next f ive years.Such approaches are pillars that support our international order.  
Because they deliver results from which citizens in all of our countries stand to benefit and 
which they expect from the United Nations.  
“We the peoples” – it’s not for nothing that these are the first three words of our Charter.  
Note that these words are not “We the member states” or “We the delegates”.  
We have an obligation to our peoples.  
We owe them a global order that allows them to live in peace, which protects their rights a nd 
opens up opportunities for education, health and development for them.  
Such an order doesn’t come about by itself. 
Defending, further developing and strengthening it  – that is our task as the United Nations. 
Germany extends the hand of cooperation to al l of you in this endeavour.

GENERAL DEBATE OF THE SEVENTY -SEVENTH SESSION OF  
 
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS  
 
 
 
STATEMENT  BY 
 
HIS EXCELLENCY  
THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS  
 
MARIO DRAGHI  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(NEW YORK, 2 0 SEPTEMBER 20 20) 
  
Mr. President,  
Mr. Secretary General,  
Honourable delegates,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
It is a great honour for me to be here today.  
The General Assembly is the place where the world opens up to dialogue 
and discussion, which are essential elements for peaceful coexistence a mong 
countries.  
As the 1945 Charter states, the objective of the United Nations is ""to 
maintain international peace and security,"" ""to promote the economic and 
social progress of all peoples.""  
Russia's aggression of Ukraine and the various crises that have  resulted - 
food, energy, economic - are putting our collective ideals at risk in a way that 
has rarely happened since the end of the Cold War.  
These crises stand alongside the other great challenges of our time - climate 
change, the Covid -19 pandemic, ine quality - and amplify their costs, 
especially for the weakest.  
The responsibilities for the conflict are clear - and one -sided.  
But it is our collective responsibility to find answers to these problems with 
urgency, determination, effectiveness. 
 We cannot divide ourselves into North and South.  
We must act together and rediscover the value of multilateralism that is 
celebrated here.  
 
The invasion of Ukraine violates the values and rules on which international 
security and the civil coexistence between countr ies have rested for decades.  
We thought we would no longer have to witness wars of aggression in 
Europe.  
Imperial ambitions, militarism, systematic violations of civil and human 
rights seemed to belong to the last century.  
Since February, however, we have witnessed the bombing of theatres, 
schools, hospitals;  
we have seen terrible attacks and violence on civilians, on children;  
we have witnessed the attempt to subjugate a free and sovereign democracy, 
which has fought back with pride and courage to defend i ts independence, 
its dignity.  
 
Helping Ukraine to protect itself was not only the right choice to make.  
It was the only choice consistent with the ideals of justice and fraternity that 
underlie the United Nations Charter and the resolutions that this Assem bly 
has adopted since the beginning of the conflict. 
 Italy acted without delay, together with the other member countries of the 
European Union, with its NATO and G7 allies, and with all partners who, 
like us, believe in a rule -based international system an d multilateralism.  
Together, we have responded to President Zelensky's request for aid, 
because a military invasion planned months earlier and carried out on 
multiple fronts cannot be stopped with words alone.  
We imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia t o weaken its military 
apparatus and to convince President Putin to sit at the negotiating table.  
We have welcomed thousands of refugees, assisted those who have remained 
in Ukraine and are ready to fund the reconstruction of the country - because 
the horro rs of war are best answered with the warmth of solidarity.  
 
Moscow's plan was to conquer Kiev in a few weeks.  
Ukrainian soldiers thwarted this attempt and, thanks in part to our military 
assistance, forced Russia into a longer and more difficult conflict.  
In the past few weeks, a heroic counteroffensive has allowed Ukraine to 
recover thousands of square kilometres of territory, starting with Kharkiv, 
and has forced the Russian army to retreat.  
The outcome of the conflict remains unpredictable, but Kiev appe ars to have 
gained an important strategic advantage.  
 
The sanctions we imposed on Moscow have had a disruptive effect on 
Russia's war machine, on its economy. 
 Russia struggles to make on its own the armaments it needs, as it finds it 
difficult to buy the m aterials required to produce them.  
The International Monetary Fund expects the Russian economy to contract 
this year and the next by about 10 percent in total, compared to 5 percent 
growth estimated before the war.  
The impact of these measures is likely t o grow over time, partly because 
some of them will take effect only in the coming months.  
With a weaker economy, it will be more difficult for Russia to respond 
effectively to the defeats that are piling up on the battlefield.  
 
The unity of the European U nion and its allies has been instrumental in 
providing Ukraine with the support it needs and to impose harsh costs on 
Russia.  
Moscow immediately tried to divide our countries, to use gas as a means of 
blackmail.  
Italy reacted promptly by diversifying gas s uppliers and by accelerating the 
production of renewable energy.  
To date, we have halved our dependence from Russian gas and expect to 
become completely independent in 2024.  
On this path, we benefitted from agreements made with many African 
countries - from Algeria to Angola to the Republic of Congo.  
We want to develop green technologies together, to put Africa squarely at 
the centre of the green transition. 
 The war in Ukraine has redrawn energy geography and with it, geopolitics.  
The European Union is set to look increasingly to the south, and Italy can 
be a bridge to the southern shore of the Mediterranean, to the African 
continent.  
 
Social cohesion is essential if we are to maintain a united, resolute position 
which is consistent with our values.  
The risi ng cost of energy jeopardizes the economic recovery, limits the 
purchasing power of households, damages the productive capacity of 
businesses, and can sap our countries' commitment to Ukraine.  
In Italy, to help businesses and citizens cope with rising infl ation we have 
spent about 3.5 percent of our gross domestic product.  
Now we need to do more, especially at a European level.  
As Italy has long argued, the European Union must impose a price cap on 
gas imports, which will also help us further reduce our pay ments to Russia.  
Europe must support member states while they support Kiev.  
 
The EU must also use the strength of its institutions to shield its neighbours 
from Russian claims.  
The war of aggression in Ukraine has awakened or strengthened the desire 
for Europe in many countries. 
 The Italian government has long championed Ukraine's bid for EU 
membership and strongly supports the integration of the Western Balkans, 
Moldova, and Geo rgia into the European Union.  
We can only emerge from crises by looking to the future - with courage and 
ambition.  
 
Our goal is peace.  
Such a peace must be deemed acceptable to Ukraine - the only one that can 
be lasting and sustainable.  
So far, Russia has not shown that it wants an end to the conflict: the 
referenda for independence in the Donbass are a new violation of 
international law, that we condemn firmly.  
Still, Italy wants to be at the forefront of efforts to try and reach an 
agreement, when this wi ll become possible.  
We have managed to do so in the past, when we highlighted how the 
blockade of Black Sea ports posed a risk to global food security.  
The agreement on Ukrainian grain exports marked an important moment of 
cooperation between parties, for which I want to thank the United Nations, 
Secretary General Guterres and Turkey.  
Our hope is that we will be able to find other ways of cooperating, starting 
with the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.  
Letting a team of experts from the International Atomi c Energy Agency 
access the plant was a step forward. 
 Now it is essential that we arrive at some form of demilitarization of the area.  
We cannot risk a nuclear catastrophe.  
 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has produced consequences that go far beyond 
Europe’s  borders.  
Rising energy prices hit the poor the hardest, exacerbating poverty and 
inequality.  
Rising food prices, scarce availability of grain and other cereals hit the 
poorest countries the hardest.  
Reduced gas supplies have forced some countries to reop en coal -fired power 
plants or postpone their closure, albeit for a period strictly related to the 
emergency.  
 
We must respond to this attack on peaceful coexistence with multilateralism, 
with a spirit of solidarity and responsibility.  
We must respond to Ru ssia’s war of aggression by reaffirming the principles 
underlying this assembly: respect for human rights, international 
cooperation, and non -belligerence.  
In his 1988 General Assembly address, Mikhail Gorbačëv noted how, in a 
globalized world, force or th e threat of its use could no longer function as 
an instrument of foreign policy. 
 ""Dealing with global problems,"" Gorbačëv said, ""requires a new 'volume' 
and a new 'quality' of cooperation"" on the part of states.  
Our reaction to the war in Ukraine serves to  reaffirm that gratuitous violence 
should have no place in the 21st century.  
Italy hopes there can be a future in which Russia returns to the principles it 
chose to subscribe to in 1945.  
A world divided into blocs, characterized by rigid ideological demarc ations 
and military confrontations cannot generate development, cannot solve 
problems.   
We must maintain our individual identities, but conduct international 
relations responsibly, legally, peacefully.  
This principle must apply to all the crises we face: from Ukraine, to the recent 
clashes in the Caucasus, to instability in Africa, the Middle East, Latin 
America, to tensions in the Indo -Pacific.  
 
Despite the divisions in recent months, we have a solid foundation on which 
to build.  
Italy’s presidency of the G20 last year coincided with a moment of great 
cooperation between countries.  
It is a legacy that we must not dissipate – and I want to recall Rome's 
readiness to host EXPO 2030, to continue to offer shared solutions to global 
problems. 
 At the most acute stage of the pandemic, we took action to overcome 
protectionism in sanitary products and ensure more vaccines for the world's 
poorest regions.  
Through the COVAX mechanism we distributed more than 1.4 billion doses 
of Covid -19 vacci nes to the countries that needed them the most.  
We enhanced financial assistance to vulnerable states to help them respond 
to the economic consequences of the pandemic and we promoted the 
extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative.  
Through a newf ound spirit of cooperation, we intensified the fight against 
climate change.  
For the first time, all G20 member states pledged to try to keep global 
warming within 1.5 degrees of pre -industrial levels and accepted the 
scientific facts behind this goal.  
We also agreed on a set of short - and medium -term responses to achieve this 
goal – and the commitments which we made at COP26 in Glasgow followed 
shortly thereafter.  
During the G20, we set out new financial contributions to help low -income 
countries transiti on to a more sustainable economy.  
We must continue to support the most vulnerable states to help them defend 
themselves against the impacts of climate change and to pursue their own 
transition paths. 
 I am thinking, for example, of the tragic flooding in Pa kistan, where a very 
large part of the country is underwater and millions of people have been 
forced to leave their homes.  
The environmental crisis affects us all, and we must come out of it together.  
 
Italy’s commitment to peace, to international solidari ty is unceasing.  
We are the largest contributor of Blue Helmets among European countries, 
and our military is deployed in five missions in the Mediterranean, Africa 
and Asia.  
In Lebanon, we participate in the UNIFIL mission with the second largest 
conting ent. 
We are very active in promoting dialogue with all countries in the wider 
Mediterranean.  
In Libya, we are committed to ensuring that the difficult process of national 
reconciliation receives strong support from the international community.  
On this jour ney, the United Nations remains our main point of reference.  
I also want to thank UN institutions for the valuable humanitarian aid they 
give in the management of migration in the Mediterranean.  
Italy is well aware that migration is a global phenomenon, an d must be 
addressed as such.  
We must have a responsible, humane and shared approach. 
 The war in Ukraine and the resulting crises have strained the cohesion of the 
international community.  
But it is precisely in this context that we need to rediscover the spirit of 
cooperation that has enabled us in past years to face similar challenges 
together.  
Our common institutions must renew themselves.  
Italy strongly supports the need to reform the UN Security Council, to make 
it more representative, efficient, trans parent.  
In the coming years, Italy will continue to be a protagonist in the EU, close 
to its NATO allies, ready to listen and open to dialogue, determined to 
contribute to international peace and security.  
These are the same principles and goals that inspire the United Nations and 
that, today, we must defend today

Page 2 of 10 Protocols:  
Mr. President,  
On behalf of the Government and people of Nigeria, I congratulate you on 
your well -deserved election as President of the 77th Session of this August 
Assembly. I assure you of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian 
delegation during your tenure.  
  
2. I commend your predecessor, H.E Abdullah Shahid for the many remarkable 
achievements of the General Assembly under his le adership during these 
challenging times.  
 
3. May I also congratulate the Secretary -General, Mr. Antonio Guterres on his 
ceaseless and untiring efforts to promote peace, security and development, very 
much in line with his exalted role.  
 
Mr. President,  
4. The first time I could have addressed this August Assembly was in 1984, 
when I was the Military Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Thirty 
one years later, I had the great privilege to personally address the Assembly in 
2015,  as the democra tically elected President of my country. As I approach the 
end of my second and final four -year term, I am reminded of how much has 
changed in Nigeria, in Africa, and in the world, and yet, how some  challenges 
remain.H.E. President Muhammadu Buhar i                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Page 3 of 10 5. We are now more severely teste d by these enduring and new global 
challenges, paramount among which are conflicts increasingly being driven by 
non-state actors, proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons, terrorism, violent 
extremism, malignant use of technology, climate change,  irr egular migration, and 
disparities in opportunities for improved standards of living.  
 
6. Despite the challenging international environment, the United Nations has 
proved that it can be strong when the  will of its members is harnessed for positive 
collecti ve action. The guiding principles of this extraordinary institution is the 
promotion of peace and security, development and human rights. Latest in a chain 
of events challenging these principles is the Ukraine conflict which has already 
created strains tha t are perhaps unprecedented for a generation.  
 
7. Such a conflict will have adverse consequences for us all, hindering our 
capacity to work together to resolve conflicts elsewhere, especially in Africa, the 
Middle -East and Asia. Indeed, the ongoing war in Ukraine is making it more difficult 
to tackle the perennial issues that feature each year in the deliberations of this 
Assembly, such as nuclear disarmament, the right of the Rohingya refugees to 
return to their homes in Myanmar, and the Palestinians’ l egitimate aspirations for 
statehood and reduction of inequalities within and amongst nations.  
 
8. The danger of escalation of the war in Ukraine further justifies Nigeria’s 
resolute calls for a nuclear -free world and a universal Arms Trade Treaty, which 
are also necessary measures to prevent global human disasters. In this regards 
we must find quick means to reach consensus on the Nuclear non -proliferation 
Treaty with related commitments by nuclear weapon states.H.E. President Muhammadu Buhar i                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Page 4 of 10 9. I  remain firmly convinced that the cha llenges that have come so sharply into 
focus in recent years and months emphasize the call by Nigeria and many other 
Member -States for the reform of the Security Council and other UN Agencies. We 
need more effective and representative structures to meet to day’s demands that 
have since outgrown a system designed for the very different world that prevailed 
at its foundation in 1945. CHANGE IS LONG OVERDUE.  
       
Mr. President,  
10.   This is the first meeting we are having here in New York without the  
restri ctions that characterised the last three years.  The COVID -19 pandemic 
ripped across National borders like a toxic whirlwind, leaving in its wake a legacy 
of pain and loss.  
 
11. Happily, we also witnessed an incredible level of innovation and creativity 
from those who devised treatments and vaccines. These laudable achievements 
were underpinned by partnerships and international cooperation. We have also 
seen the bravery, care, and endurance of health professionals at every corner of 
the globe.  
  
12. I am happy to note that in Nigeria, our healthcare agencies were able to form 
effective local management and engaged international partnerships with 
multinational initiatives like COVAX and private groups like the Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation. These e fforts helped mitigate the impact of the pandemic and 
we were mercifully spared the images of overwhelmed hospitals, overworked 
healthcare personnel and high mortality which sadly we saw elsewhere.H.E. President Muhammadu Buhar i                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Page 5 of 10 13. With COVID -19, we saw very clearly how states tried  to meet the challenge 
of a threat that could not be contained within national borders. The results were 
mixed; but at its best, cooperation among stakeholders was outstanding. It 
facilitated solutions that saved countless lives and eased the huge burden o f 
human suffering.  
 
14. That same theme of unilateralism and the promotion of national interest 
competing with the common cause in the face of an existential threat has been our 
recurring experience in recent times.  In every address I have delivered to t his 
august Assembly, I have dwelt on the issue of climate change, especially as it fuels 
conflicts and complicates food security.  
 
15. Climate change reduces opportunity and prosperity which, in Africa, Latin 
America and some parts of Asia also contribute to transnational organized crimes.  
 
16. As part of Nigeria’s efforts at achieving our Global Net -zero aspiration, the 
current Administration last year adopted a National Climate Change Strategy that 
aims to deliver climate change mitigation in a sustainab le manner.  
 
17. The measures we took at the national level also require climate justice. Africa 
and other developing nations produce only a small proportion of greenhouse gas 
emissions, compared to industrial economies. Yet, we are the hardest hit by the 
consequences of climate change as we see in the sustained droughts in Somalia 
and floods of unprecedented severity in Pakistan.H.E. President Muhammadu Buhar i                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Page 6 of 10 18. These and other climate -related occurrences are now sadly becoming widely 
commonplace in the developing world. We are, in ef fect, literally paying the price 
for policies that others pursue.  This needs to change.  
 
19. At the Cop 26 in Glasgow last year, I did say that Nigeria was not asking for 
permission to make the same mistakes that others have made in creating the 
climate e mergency.  
 
20. Fortunately, we now know what we can do to mitigate the effects of the 
climate crisis and the related energy challenge. As a first step, we must all commit 
to releasing the financing and the technology to create a stable and affordable 
frame work for energy transition.  
 
21. Development Financial Institutions must prioritise de -risking energy projects 
to improve access of renewable projects to credit facilities. There should be no 
countries “left behind” in this equation.  
 
22. Rocketing energy costs worldwide are, in part, the product of conflict and 
supply disruptions to Europe and the Americas. Yet, we are all paying the price. It 
is, therefore, our expectation that this UNGA 77 and the upcoming COP 27 will 
help galvanise the political will re quired to drive action towards the fulfilment of the 
various existing climate change initiatives.H.E. President Muhammadu Buhar i                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Page 7 of 10 23. Another feature of the last decade has been the gowing partnership between 
states and the increasingly influential non -state actors. There was a time w hen the 
most important event at this Assembly was the speech by the world’s most 
powerful leaders. Now a Tweet or Instagram post by an influencer on social or 
environmental issues may have greater impact.  
 
24. Technology offers us nearly limitless opportunities and sometimes runs 
ahead of the imagination of regulators and legislators. At its best, social media 
helps strengthen the foundations of our society and our common values.  At its 
worst, it is a corrosive  digital version of the mob, bristling with intolerance and 
division.  
 
25. When I began my tenure as President in 2015, distinctions were drawn 
between the experience of poorer countries and those apparently better able to 
manage the avalanche of unfiltered information. Nigeria has had many  unsavoury 
experiences with hate speech  and divisive disinformation. Increasingly, we also 
see that many countries face the same challenge. Clearly, data also know no 
borders.  
 
26. In confronting these challenges, we must also come together to defend 
freedom of speech, while upholding other va lues that we cherish. We must 
continue to work for a common standard that balances rights with responsibilities 
to keep the most vulnerable from harm and help strengthen and enrich 
communities.H.E. President Muhammadu Buhar i                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Page 8 of 10 27. Efforts to protect communities from the scourge of disi nformation and 
misinformation must also be matched with efforts to reduce inequalities and restore 
hope to our poorer and most vulnerable of our communities as a means to stem 
the many socio -economic conflict drivers with which we are faced.  
 
28. In spite of our efforts, humanitarian crises will continue to ravage some of 
our communities. Nigeria, therefore, implores our global partners to do more to 
complement our endeavours.  
 
29. Indeed, the multifaceted challenges facing most developing countries have 
placed a debilitating chokehold on their fiscal space. This equally calls for the need 
to address the burden of unsustainable external debt  by a global commitment to 
the expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to countries 
facing f iscal and liquidity challenges as well as outright cancellation for countries 
facing the most severe challenges.  
 
Mr. President, Your Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates,  
30. Democracy is an idea that crosses time and borders. Certainly, democracy 
does have its limitations. The wheels of democracy turn slowly. It can demand 
compromises that dilute decisions. Sometimes, it bends too much to special 
interests that exercise influence, not always for the general good, in a manner 
disproportionate to their nu mbers. But it has been my experience that a democratic 
culture provides a Government with the legitimacy it needs to deliver positive 
change.H.E. President Muhammadu Buhar i                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Page 9 of 10 31. In Nigeria, not only have we worked to strengthen our democracy, but we 
have supported it and promoted the Rule of Law in our sub -region. In The Gambia, 
we helped guarantee the first democratic transition since independence. In 
Guinea -Bissau we stood by the democratically elected Government when it faced 
mutiny. And  in the Republic of Chad, following the tragi c death of its President, 
the late Idris Deby Itno in the battle field, we joined forces with its other neighbours 
and international partners to stabilize the country and encourage the peaceful 
transition to democracy, a process which is ongoing.  
 
32. We believe in the sanctity of constitutional term limits and we have 
steadfastly adhered to it in Nigeria. We have seen the corrosive impact on values 
when leaders elsewhere seek to change the rules to stay on in power. Indeed, we 
now are preparing for genera l elections in Nigeria next February. At the 78th 
UNGA, there will be a new face at this podium speaking for Nigeria.  
 
33. Ours is a vast country strengthened by its diversity and its common values 
of hard work, enduring faith and a sense of community. We  have invested heavily 
to strengthen our framework for free and fair elections. I thank our partners for all 
the support that they have provided our election institutions.  
 
34. As President, I have set the goal that one of the enduring legacies I would 
like to leave is  to entrench a process of free, fair and transparent  and credible 
elections through which Nigerians elect leaders of their choice.H.E. President Muhammadu Buhar i                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Page 10 of 10 Mr. President,  
35. The multiple challenges that face us are truly   interconnected and urgent, 
and your choice of this Session's theme “A watershed moment: transformative 
solutions to interlocking challenges” is apt. In keeping with our obligations as 
Member States of this noble Organisation, we all must do our utmost to work with 
you toward resolving t hem. In this regard, I reiterate my Delegation's full 
and  resolute cooperation.   
 
36. Let me convey my final reflection from this famous podium. We live in 
extraordinary times with interdependent challenges but enormous opportunities. 
The pace of change c an seem bewildering, with sometimes a palpable and 
unsettling sense of uncertainty about our future. But if my years in public service 
have taught me anything, it is that we must keep faith with those values that 
endure. These include, but are not limited to such values as justice, honour, 
integrity, ceaseless endeavour, and partnership within and between nations.  
 
37. Our strongest moments have always been when we remain true to the basic 
principles of tolerance, community, and abiding commitment to peace and goodwill 
towards all.  
 
 I thank you all.", NGA,2022

His Excellency Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi  
President of the Islamic Republic of Iran  
 
At the General Debate  
of the United Nations General Assembly  
 
21 September 2022  
 
 
In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful  
Praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and His Peace and Blessings be upon 
Muhammad and His Pure Household and His Select Companions  
O Lord, send our greetings to the pure souls of the great prophets, ""Abraham, Moses, Jesus and 
Muhammad"", may God's blessings be up on them, who brought the message of ""rationality, justice, 
spirituality and morality"" to the world and destroyed the foundations of ignorance and oppression, so 
that people can build a better world for themselves.  
Mr Chairman  
Ladies and gentlemen  
The basic  yardstick for building a better world is justice.  All human ideals are ultimately measured by 
justice.  ""Rationality based on revelation"" believes in a broad framework for justice;  Justice means 
negation of injustice.  We are the standard -bearer of justice that negates all levels of oppression, 
including ""oppression to oneself, God, society, and the universe.""  The desire to establish justice is a 
divine deposit in everyone's existence, and the accumulation of injustice causes nations to move in the form of p opular revolutions.  
Although many movements did not reach the maturity of the revolution and many revolutions deviated from their original path, the success of some nations, such as the Iranian nation, in continuing the nature of their revolution, has kept  the hope of establishing justice alive in the hearts of the people of 
the world.The Iranian Islamic Revolution was the crystallisation of the movement of the Iranian nation towards 
justice, which despite various seditions, has been able to protect the di gnity and originality of its 
ideals.  In the first step, the nation of Iran built the foundation of an advanced civil -political order based 
on ""rationality emanating from revelation"" in the name of the Islamic Republic, and in the second step, it seeks to f orm a ""just international order and system"".  The key elements in this path are ""godliness, 
awareness, altruism, and multilateralism"".  
Ladies and gentlemen  
I am proud to represent a nation that has a great civilisational heritage.  A nation that has always b een 
free and has thwarted the attempts of hegemons to enslave its destiny for centuries.  A nation that has 
always considered oppression as a cause of destruction and throughout its history has also fought 
against the captivity of other nations from ""Babylo nian captivity"" to ""Palestinian captivity"".  
We believe in a common destiny for humanity and support the universalisation of justice.  We wish for 
others what we like for ourselves and we do not impose on others what we do not like for 
ourselves.  The Iranian  nation believes that justice creates unity, and oppression creates war.  
If a country claims justice inside itself, but abroad, it trains all kinds of terrorists and kills the nations, or 
forces the nations to surrender by imposing various pressures, it sh ould be a shame for humanity, 
freedom, and justice  
Humanity is not exclusive to a part of human beings, and human rights are not conceived except by 
securing the rights of all human beings.  Inspired by religious beliefs and based on the spirit and text of 
its constitution, the Islamic Republic of Iran has one of the most efficient mechanisms in the protection 
of human rights, and with the most effective tools, considers the fulfilment of the violated rights of each 
person as a human mission, a sovereign res ponsibility, and a divine duty delegated to it by the 
people.  The Islamic Republic considers the double standards of some governments in the field of human 
rights as the most important factor in the institutionalisation of human rights violations, which re sults in 
diverse and numerous positions towards an incident under investigation in the Islamic Republic of Iran and the deathly silence about the killing of dozens of helpless women in a short time in one of the western countries.  As long as this double st andards persists, human rights will not be safe from 
repeated violations.  
Above human rights, the rights of nations are easily trampled by oppressive powers.  The right of 
Canadian indigenous communities whose children were buried in mass graves in schoolyards instead of 
school classes;  the right to self- determination of the Palestinian nation, the right to development of 
nations under sanctions, the right to life of nations under occupation or victims of terrorism, the right to 
life of homeless refugees who  keep children in cages separate from their mothers and fathers;  all of 
them show that the position of the claimant and the accused in the issue of human rights should not be 
changed and that the real violators of human rights do not have the necessary moral competence to 
comment on human rights.  Iran's unique role in the destruction of ISIS, which only one of its crimes was 
enslaving Kurdish, Yazidi and Christian women, is enough to show that we are in the position of the 
claimant and defender of human rig hts, and the supporters of ISIS are in the position of the accused.  
Distinguished audienceNow we have come together in a situation where we are facing an important reality, that is, ""turning 
and changing the world"" and entering a ""new era and order"".  The old world, the world of 
""unilateralism"", ""domination -seeking"", ""dominance of capital over morality, justice and virtue"", 
""developer of poverty, discrimination and inequality"", ""use of violence, sanctions and violation of the rights of nations"" and ""use of international organisations and institutions as a tool of pressure on independent countries"" and in a word, the world is unfair in every way.  This unfair order has lost its 
legitimacy in the public opinion of the world and serious wills have been formed to  change it.  The 
decline of this old order is undeniable.  Our region, that is West Asia, from Afghanistan to Iraq, Lebanon, 
Palestine and proud Iran, is the great museum of the decline of this old order.  
In addition to that, the growing threat of terrorism and extremism, cultural decline and the deterioration of political ethics, the unprecedented weakening of multilateralism and the pathological 
growth of unilateral illegitimate actions have created great challenges on the path of comprehensive 
progress and  human excellence.  
We believe that there is no other option than solidarity and cooperation in the framework of multilateralism based on justice, and based on the principles and transcendent human values emanating 
from the teachings of divine prophets, t o deal with ancient threats and modern global problems.  
Distinguished audience  
All the free nations have these high values, but this series of beliefs is the reason for all the enmity of the oppressors of the world against us.  What we want is the rights of the Iranian nation and we do not 
tolerate a relationship based on oppression.  We stand for the rights of our nation.  We believe that any 
oppressive relationship is detrimental to global peace and security, and the most important threat to 
the glo bal community is the ""normalisation of oppression"".  Achieving global security through any means 
other than justice will not be sustainable, and that is what we expect the United Nations to do.  
Yes, it is difficult to implement justice and maybe that is why  many self- proclaimed advocates of peace 
are running away from justice.  Our question to these governments is that if you do not have the will to 
implement justice, do you not have the desire to deal with oppression?  
Our logic is rooted in the Qur'anic cult ure that said ""Do not oppress and do not be oppressed.""  The fate 
of many nations is determined by this phrase.  Those who do not benefit from the ""power of logic"" resort 
to ""logic of force"".  Logic that is based on justice is powerful and rules hearts.  A cou ntry that does not 
have logic, resorts to coups, occupation, military intervention, army killings, indiscriminate treatment of 
terrorism and many other atrocities and injustices.  Did resorting to nuclear weapons lead the world to 
justice or did it become t he basis of domination?  The killing of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi, Yemeni, 
Syrian, and Afghan children was in the service of which human cause?  Aren't these manifestations of 
oppression and injustice in the world?  
Indeed, what did Iran demand other tha n demanding its legal and just rights, which has made world 
powers upset?  
Dear colleagues  
Today, hegemony and the spirit of the Cold War are scourging the world and a new era of unrest is threatening our world.  The desire of the nations of the world to rea lise justice has become more intenseand their will for progress, independence and security has become more serious.  The fruitfulness of the 
doctrine of resistance is a clear manifestation of the determination of nations to realise justice.  
But on the othe r hand, unilateralism seeks to hold countries back from their independent development 
path.  America cannot accept that countries stand on their own feet, and is naïve o think that militarism 
is a source of security.  
America's friends are not better off.  What is happening in Europe today is a mirror of what happened in 
the past decades in West Asia.  The nature of the deployment of troops to West Asia and the expansion 
of NATO to Eastern Europe are not different from each other, because in both, the fate of the countries 
is defined by the America who pursues its own interests at the expense of others.  
Mr President, dear audience  
The Islamic revolution was the beginning of the movement of the Iranian nation to reach its rightful 
position and during this period,  it went through various crises such as coups, domestic terrorism, 
separatism, war, chaos and sanctions, none of which alone, could be tolerated by many countries.  
More than 40 years have passed since the then President of Iran, Mohammad Ali Rajai, placed his foot on this podium, the traces of torture by the US -backed regime were visible on.  After that speech, he was 
martyred by the American -backed terrorist group.  
Four decades ago, the nation of Iran, under the leadership of Imam Khomeini (RA), mastered it s own 
destiny by expelling foreigners from its country, and now the nations of the region are trying to take 
control of their own destiny by following that experience.  
The Iranian nation, which itself has been a victim of terrorism, has today become the pillar of security in 
the region and the true vanguard of the fight against terrorism in the world.  
The Iranian nation has paid a price to achieve its lofty and just goals;  Whether it was when Saddam tore 
up the Algerian agreement and started a full- scale military war against us, and when the former 
American president violated the nuclear agreement and launched a full- scale economic war and 
unveiled a new form of crime against humanity.  
Some time ago, the former president of the United States announced that I SIS was created by the 
United States;  It doesn't matter to us that ISIS was created by which of the American governments.  The 
problem is that a government on the other side of the globe decided to redraw the geography of our 
region at the cost of shedding the blood of hundreds of thousands of women and children, but the 
Islamic Republic stopped this project and then pushed it back.  The commander and hero of this war 
against terrorism and the destroyer of ISIS was none other than Lieutenant General Haj Qasem  
Soleimani.  The one who was martyred in the path of the freedom of the nations of the region and the 
former president of the United States printed his name on the case of this crime.  
The fair trial of the crime to which the former American president has co nfessed is a service to 
humanity;  So that the hearts of those who have been hurt by this oppression can somehow find relief 
from this oppression that has been done to the nations of the region.  The fair treatment of the crime 
that the former president of the United States has confessed to is a service to humanity, so that from 
now on, cruelty will be silenced and justice will prevail.  We will follow the implementation of justice andthe trial of the commander and supervisor of the martyrdom of Lt. Gen. Qase m Soleimani through a fair 
court until a definitive result is reached.  
Ladies and gentlemen  
The story of the Iranian nation is the story of a nation that has learned to stand on its own feet and not 
rely on others;  it learned this experience when it declar ed impartiality in both world wars, but was 
occupied militarily in both times;  Or where it resorted to the United States in order to nationalise the oil 
industry to save itself from British colonialism, but they staged a coup against the Iranian government  at 
the time;  And since in a multilateral international agreement that was approved by the UN Security 
Council, it promised to lift the sanctions, but it found itself facing the most brutal system of sanctions.  
Dear audience, ladies and gentlemen  
Having the same attitude and those experiences, the Iranian nation has followed the policy of persistence and progress. It is because of the same advanced, stable and rational political and civil order 
that despite sanctions and threats, Islamic Iran is today a strong country, with huge scientific and 
technical achievements and unparalleled independence in the region and the world.  We believe that 
today the world needs a ""strong Iran"".  
Today, while exporting oil and gas, we have created a wide network of electricity  and gas distribution 
throughout the country; we are leaders in advanced science and knowledge, including stem cells, space industries, bio and nanotechnology, and nuclear sciences; Iran's growth in Human development indicators are impressive.  Social welfare infrastructures, including insurance coverage, have been widely 
established for Iran's 85 million population, and democracy has been comprehensively institutionalised 
in the ruling structure of the Islamic Republic and has become the basic procedure of the system.  While 
we were sanctioned during the war, even to buy barbed wire, we have now reached the point of 
deterrence by acquiring the technical know -how of the most advanced military equipment.  This is 
despite the fact that during all this period, we witnessed the increasing hostility of America against the 
progress of the Iranian nation.  
People of the world  
Dear audience,  
Mr President  
It was not our enemies who relieved the pressure, but it was our nation that drove every enemy out of the field.  The I ranian nation, with its effective presence and comprehensive participation in the political 
order arising from the Islamic Revolution, was able to go through the first stage of the Islamic Revolution 
with strength and success while adhering to the values and inspiring the nations, and now in the second 
stage, ""neighbourhood policy"" and ""deepening economic multilateralism"" is the priority of its foreign policy agenda.  
 The Islamic Republic of Iran wants maximum interaction with all the countries of the world, especially 
its neighbouring and friendly countries.  War is not the solution to crises, but the way to solve crises is 
dialogue and understanding.  As a powerful country in the region, the Islamic Republic of Iran has the will 
and ability to help solve c rises.  In the past year, Iran's economic ties have been strengthened, and its 
regional trade has grown significantly, and with the expansion of sustainable economic cooperationinfrastructure, a new chapter of friendship and mutual trust has emerged.  This neighbourhood policy is 
a policy that creates security and stability.  We have proved that we are friends of our neighbours during 
their hardships.  
In all the numerous conversations I have had with regional heads and leaders, one of the most 
important commo n points is that the security of the region must be provided ""endogenously and 
without external interference"" and the way to achieve this is cooperation, not dividing the world into 
blocs.  The upcoming era is the era of ""stable cooperation, prosperity, stability and brotherhood"", if the 
fate of the region is determined by the countries of the region.  Occupiers and usurpers will be gone one 
day and neighbours stay for each other for good.  
Once upon a time, they created a war between the two nations of Iran a nd Iraq, but today, the greatest 
symbol of brotherhood and cultural event in the world, namely the Arba'een procession, is held with the unparalleled effort of the people of Iraq and Iran and other nations of the world to commemorate Imam 
Hussein (AS), the  progeny of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and glorify him who sacrificed his life and his 
family to free people from ignorance and free them from oppression.  
Distinguished audience  
I would like to draw your attention to one of the sad manifestations of injustice, which is the source of 
all crises in the region.  Contemporary history has not seen a nation more oppressed than Palestine and 
crueller than the occupying regime in Al- Quds.  The Zionist Regime, which has more than seventy years 
of apartheid, oppression and murder of women and children in its dark history, has built the largest 
prison on earth in Gaza, and the continuation of settlement construction and the images of the 
oppres sed Palestinians crying due to the usurpation of their lands, homes and farms, and the killing of 
their children, show everyone that seven decades of oppression and occupation by Israel is not over.  
Governments claiming freedom and democracy must answer wh y they are running away from the clear 
and fair formula of the Islamic Republic to solve the Palestinian issue?  In oppressed Palestine, we 
believe in the policy of a single Palestine.  All the land of Palestine ""from the sea to the river"" belongs to 
the ori ginal inhabitants of this historic and holy land.  The solution to the Palestinian issue is only to refer 
to the votes of all Palestinians, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, in the form of holding a comprehensive referendum.  
The occupying regime of Al -Quds, which continues to occupy the territories of other countries in the 
region, cannot be a partner in peace and security.  
Honourable audience  
Let me draw your attention to another manifestation of injustice, which is the West's double- standard 
position  towards Iran's peaceful nuclear activities.  While the basic pillar of global security is ""global 
disarmament"", some powers are trying to make the world forget the main issue of global disarmament 
by making Iran's peaceful activities a problem.  
As the repr esentative of the great nation of Iran, I explicitly declare that the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
not seeking to develop nuclear weapons and such weapons have no place in our defence doctrine.  This 
ruling was announced in the fatwa of the Supreme Leader of  the Islamic Revolution, and for the Iranian 
government and people, the religious fatwa of the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution is more 
effective than any international supervision.This is despite the fact that the self -proclaimed governments have  continued to produce and use nuclear 
weapons and have gifted these weapons to the Zionist Regime.  Countries that have to be disarmed are 
rewarded, and countries that have adhered to their commitments are even deprived of the rights 
contained in the NPT.  While Iran's peaceful nuclear programme includes only two percent of the world's 
nuclear programs, 35 percent of inspections are of our facilities.  
Now, I would like to ask the audience to carefully pay attention to a few points:  
1- The Islamic Republic acc epted an agreement in 2015 in good faith and with a solid intention and 
fulfilled all its commitments in the first place, but the result was America breaking its promise and imposing sanctions which, according to their own admission, were the most unpreced ented sanctions in 
history.  Sanctions are a punishment for seeking justice and independence of the Iranian nation.  Sanction 
is a weapon of mass murder, and accompanying or remaining silent towards it is aiding and abetting 
oppression.  
2- It was America that left the agreement, not Iran.  The International Atomic Energy Agency stated 15 
times in its reports that Iran has fully adhered to the provisions of the agreement.  
3- At the same time, Iran has paid the cost of complying with its obligations, but due to the violation of 
the promise of the American side and the non -compliance of the European side, Iran has not enjoyed 
the benefits of this agreement.  
Based on the capacities seen in the agreement, we took legal measures so that the violating party 
returns to  its obligations.  By adhering to its obligations, Iran has been the main axis of the JCPOA's 
survival, and if it were not for the initiatives and flexibility of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the 
negotiations would have stopped in the first days.  
Iran's negotiation logic based on a fair analysis of developments is only one sentence: ""adherence to commitments"".  Reassuring assurances are not just about preparing for a contingency.  We are talking 
about an experience.  We have before us the experience of America' s withdrawal from the JCPOA and 
the delay of the current American government in returning to its commitments for more than a year and 
a half.  Today, when the American government is talking about its intention to return to its obligations, 
another voice is heard from inside that country, which questions the commitment of the United 
States.  With that experience and this perspective, can we act with tolerance in the important issue of 
ensuring the stability of the agreement?  
Of course, the Islamic Republic, wi th its vast facilities and wide connections with the world, has 
neutralised the effects of sanctions one after another and created new opportunities.  According to the 
official admission of the US government, the policy of maximum pressure against Iran has failed 
shamefully.  
We will find our way regardless of any agreement and continue with strength.  Besides, in the serious 
negotiations we have had, we have shown that if the interests of the Iranian nation are guaranteed, we have a strong will to solve this issue fairly.  We believe that the knot of the nuclear agreement should be 
untied from the place where it was tied.  
Dear friends and colleaguesThe last part of my speech is about the necessity of global justice.  All of us and each and every human 
being in the world must actively and committedly participate in the construction of the new world.  If the 
new world wants to be a morally legitimate world, accepted by the people of the world, and successful 
and victorious in terms of its ability to solve global pr oblems, it has no way but to be formed on the axis 
of global justice.  This requires paying attention to principles such as ""a sense of global shared 
responsibility against oppression and injustice"", ""respecting the will of nations and not interfering in 
their independent growth"", ""negating double standards"", ""opposition to war and violence"". , ""the 
independence and fair functioning of international institutions"", and most importantly ""the role of 
righteous and just people in shaping this new order"".  
Our vie w of the future is very hopeful.  We faithfully believe that based on God's providence and will, as 
God's prophets have given good news, justice will become universal and the government of God's 
righteous servants will rule the earth and humanity will be re deemed with the appearance of the last 
saviour.  
Thank you for your attention.  
Peace be upon you and may God have mercy on you.

 MNG_77_2022," Please check against delivery  STATEMENT BY H.E. MR. KHURELSUKH UKHNAA, PRESIDENT OF MONGOLIA,  AT THE GENERAL DEBATE OF THE 77th SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY   (New York, 21 September 2022)  Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Distinguished delegates, Ladies and gentlemen,  I wish to convey my heartfelt congratulations to Your Excellency Mr. Csaba Kőrösi on your unanimous election as the President of the UN General Assembly and wish every success in the work of the 77th session.  We have no doubt that the 77th session of the General Assembly will play an important role in intensifying social and economic recovery of the countries of the world in the post pandemic epoque, implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, combating climate change and desertification, and determining ways to resolve international crises and conflicts through dialogue and peaceful means.   Last year, we celebrated the 60th anniversary of Mongolia’s full pledged membership to the United Nations, and this year, we are observing the 30th anniversary of Mongolia’s declaration of its territory as a nuclear weapon free zone, and the 20th anniversary of Mongolia’s participation in the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations.    Therefore, on behalf of my country and people, it is a great privilege for me to state from this honorable podium that during these six decades, Mongolia has been a responsible member of the United Nations actively participating in multilateral cooperation of the international community and making tangible contribution to global peace and security, as well as wellbeing and development of mankind.    Mr. President,  The whole world is going through hard times of difficult ordeals and challenges, such as poverty, inequality, climate change, pandemic and the pandemic-driven difficulties to customs, transport and logistics, price increase, inflation, as well as geostrategic and geopolitical tensions. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute report, even in the difficult times, when the countries of the world were closing their borders, imposing restrictions and quarantines to protect lives and health of their citizens from the COVID-19 pandemic, and running into economic crises, the world military expenditure continued to grow in 2021, reaching an all-time high of USD 2.1 trillion.   If this huge budget and funds spent on the military and armaments were dedicated to the least developed and developing countries, how many millions of children’s future would have been brighter, how many millions would have been lifted out of poverty, how many millions would have been freed from hunger and disease, how many millions would have had food, and opportunities for education, employment, and places to live.  It is time for all of us to ponder and reflect on what progress could have been achieved if this huge amount of money had been spent on the pressing issues of combating global warming and climate change.  It is truly regrettable that the situation in the world is deteriorating, and mistrust and misunderstanding are deepening even though in the XX century the mankind has had enough sufferings, such as the scourge of the two World Wars, the Cold War divide, interreligious conflicts, and terrorism.   Therefore, in today’s complex reality, we should always strive to learn from the mistakes of the past, uphold mutual trust, understanding, and respect, and make every effort to resolve any misunderstanding, conflict or war by peaceful means and dialogue.   Eight centuries ago, our ancestor - the Great Chinggis Khaan, united all Mongolian dwellers, founded the Great Mongolian State under the power of the Eternal Blue Sky, put an end to the centuries-long wars and conflicts, pacified West and East under the statehood rule of justice, and established the ""Pax Mongolica"" in the vast terrain of Eurasia.  Scholars and researchers around the world view the establishment of the ""Pax Mongolica"" as an important contribution of Mongols to the world history and the advancement of humankind and emphasize that the ""Pax Mongolica"" played an important role in the development of free trade between countries, laid the foundation for diplomacy and exchange of envoys, as well as proclaimed the ideas of religious freedom and the rule of law without imposing one's culture and religion on others.   The UN General Assembly resolution entitled “Eight Hundred Years of Mongolian Statehood”, adopted in 2005, highly appreciated the contribution of Mongols to the history of mankind and recognized that “nomadic civilization influenced, inter alia, societies across Asia and Europe and, in turn, absorbed influences from both East and West in a true interchange of human values, further recognized the important role played by a strong and persistent nomadic culture in the development of extensive trade networks and the creation of large administrative, cultural, religious and commercial centres, and likewise acknowledged the ever-increasing significance and relevance of a culture of living in harmony with nature, which is inherent in nomadic civilization, in today’s world”. This indicates that the “Pax Mongolica"" contained progressive ideas, which could form the basis of the collective efforts of the international community to maintain peace and stability in the modern world.  Therefore, we, the descendants of the founders of the “Pax Mongolica”, call on the international community to understand each other, cooperate, and manage any conflict through peaceful dialogue, so that our blue planet will be at peace, and a ""Pax Globalica"" will be established. We further call on people of the world to combine efforts to achieve this noble goal.  Mongolia has consistently pursued a peace-loving, open, multi-pillar and independent foreign policy. A clear recognition of this policy by the international community was expressed by the UN Secretary-General António Guterres as “a symbol of peace in a troubled world” during his official visit to Mongolia in August 2022.   Mongolia has been actively participating in the promotion of international peace and security and peacekeeping efforts has put forward numbers of proposals and initiatives in the past. A notable example of which is the declaration of its territory as a nuclear-weapon-free zone.  In his statement at the opening of the 10th Review Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons held last August, the UN Secretary-General warned that humanity is just “one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation”.  In this connection, I urge not only States Parties to the treaty, but also all UN Member States to exert political will and courage to build a world free of nuclear weapons, unite and work together wholeheartedly and faithfully for the sake of our Mother Earth, peace, and future generations.  Mongolia considers that nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation, complete elimination of nuclear weapons and establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones are the best and effective means of building a world free of nuclear weapons.  Therefore, we consider that international recognition of Mongolia’s nuclear-weapon-free status is our tangible contribution and effort to this cause.   Mr. President,  This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Mongolia’s participation in the UN Peacekeeping Operations (UN PKO). During this period, more than 20 thousand Mongolian military personnel have served in the UN PKO and other international peacekeeping operations in hot spots around the world.  Since 2006, when Mongolia sent its first female officer to the UN Peacekeeping Operations, by the number of female peacekeepers, we are among the top 20 countries in the ranking of 120 troop contributing countries.   Mongolia is firmly committed to the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security and the call by the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations to increase the number of women serving in the UN Peacekeeping Operations to 15 percent by 2027.  Within the framework of this objective, at the initiative of Mongolia, we have hosted an international conference on “Strengthening the Role of Women in Peacekeeping” last June. The conference, which brought together female peacekeepers from more than 30 countries and representatives of international organizations, became a notable event for sharing and exchanging knowledge, experience and lessons learned.   We have also has put forward an initiative to host this conference every 5 years and it is our hope that the relevant UN entities and troop-contributing countries will support this proposal.   At the same time, it is my pleasure to underscore that the UN and its leadership have been greatly appreciating the genuine contribution of peace-loving Mongolia to the UN PKO and the sacred cause of strengthening international peace and security and rendering full support to our proposals and initiatives.    Mr. President,   Mongolia has consistently proposed the establishment of a dialogue mechanism, with a view to contribute to the peace and security in the Northeast Asian region and the efforts of the international community to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.    In this context, in 2013, Mongolia has launched the initiative to organize the international conference “Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security”.   Last June, we organized the 7th international conference of the “Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security” and discussed a broad range of issues, including regional security, power grid, green development, opportunities for humanitarian cooperation, and the post-COVID economic recovery.  The results of the conference demonstrate that the significance of the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue initiative has grown, and it is transforming into an open and inclusive mechanism gathering government officials and the academia from countries in the sub-region and beyond and representatives of international organizations.  In the face of frequent natural disasters and communicable diseases, the creation of an integrated regional infrastructure for disaster risk reduction and humanitarian assistance is becoming one of the most pressing security issues in Northeast Asia.  With this in mind, we put forward an initiative to establish an integrated platform for disaster risk reduction for the Northeast Asian region in Mongolia in 2018, and now we bring forward a proposal to establish a regional humanitarian hub or warehouse based on the Ulaanbaatar International Airport affiliated facilities.  I am confident that these initiatives will be supported and assisted by other countries in the region and the UN system and specialized organizations.   Mr. President,  Broad scale economic restrictions and sanctions, caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts, have hit hard the national economies. The global market prices of food, fuel, agricultural and energy raw materials have increased sharply like never before, causing fluctuation in the global economy and financial markets and creating major risks.  With the immediate support of the UN and its system organizations and development partners to Mongolia’s efforts against COVID-19, as of today, 70 percent of the population are fully vaccinated, domestic restrictions removed and borders opened.   Though we are going through an uneasy period, the Government of Mongolia is implementing the New Recovery Policy developed in coherence with the Sustainable Development Goals. The policy focuses on improvement of road, railway, and border point infrastructure, increase of energy sources, intensification of industrialization, as well as urban and rural development, and enhancement of public-private partnership, and productivity.  Furthermore, despite tough times of the pandemic and new normalcy, Mongolia is putting efforts to accelerate digital transition, and adopted a package of new laws on digital development. We have introduced the e-Mongolia platform to streamline public service delivery to citizens and entities, to reduce corruption and bureaucracy, to increase information security, and to promote good governance. Moreover, we are working to expand and develop our multilateral cooperation in these fields at regional and international levels.   Mongolia fully supports major initiatives put forward in the UN Secretary-General’s report “Our Common Agenda” and is sparing no efforts to implement them in close coordination with the Sustainable Development Goals, the national “Vision-2050” long-term development policy and the “New Recovery Policy”.  Mr. President,   We must not forget that serious challenges we are facing, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, desertification, land degradation, shortages of water resources and droughts, are still awaiting solutions.   Mongolia is one of the countries most affected by climate change.   Therefore, with a view to combat climate change, desertification, and dust storms, and to increase forest and water resources, Mongolia launched the ""Billion Trees"" national movement to plant, grow and protect billions of trees.   Mongolian people, the Government and development partners welcomed the initiative, and now the ""Billion Trees"" national movement is being successfully implemented throughout the country. I am pleased to inform that the UN Secretary-General personally joined and supported the movement.   In addition, Mongolia reiterates its position to actively cooperate and make a real contribution to reduce the negative impact of climate change and protecting the environment at regional and international levels.   In this context, it is my pleasure to inform you that Mongolia will be hosting the 17th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP17) in 2026.   Another issue, which should be brought to the attention, is the scarcity of pastures, as the space for nomadic livestock, is shrinking day by day, and nomadic civilization is facing a danger of extinction.     We, Mongolians, are nomadic and pastoralist people. Lives of over 200 million people, raising livestock and living in harmony with the nature like us, are at risk now due to climate change, land degradation, desertification, drought and extreme winter calamities. In order to protect their interests, improve pasture management and use, preserve ecosystem balance, and provide global food security and supply, Mongolia initiated a UNGA resolution proclaiming the year of 2026 as the “International year of Rangelands and Pastoralists”, and it was adopted on March 15, 2022.  We launched the “Billion trees” national movement along with the national programs on “Food Supply and Security” and “Healthy Mongolia” to implement the Sustainable Development Goals and create a healthy environment, where people would live a healthy life consuming healthy food. We highly appreciate the support and cooperation of the countries in the region and international organizations extended to these endeavors.  Mr. President,   Nowadays, with the drastic change of the international order and norms, established after the World War II, the importance of multilateralism and the role of international community are growing ever more.  For this reason, we are of the view that it is important for every Member State to take an active part in the process of the UN reforms and constructively contribute to strengthening the position and role of the organization.   Mongolia views that the key to the reform of the UN is the reform of the Security Council, which bears the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.   Since 2009, Mongolia has been regularly participating in the Intergovernmental Negotiations on the UN Security Council reform, expressing its principled position.  Developments in recent years have proven that the UN General Assembly is the most important platform for discussing global peace, security, human rights, and development issues. So, we deem that strengthening the role of the UN General Assembly is important to ensure the balance of power among countries and bring out voices of small and developing countries more vividly.   Lastly, I wish to call upon the Member States to support the UN ""Quintet of change"" outlined in the Secretary-General’s report “Our Common Agenda” for a more effective UN 2.0 and let us collectively exert our efforts to ensure global peace, security, and development and prosperity.   May the Eternal Blue Sky bless the mankind forever!    Thank you for your attention.", MNG,2022

 BIH_77_2022,"[Address by Šefik Džaferović, Chairman of the Presidency of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the General Debate of the 77th 
Session of the United Nations General Assembly, New York, 
21 September 2022]  
 
Mr. President,  
Secretary General,  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
 
It is my honor to address this esteemed body, as the Chairman 
of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  
 
I congratulate Mr. Shahid on successfully presiding over the 
76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Despite 
the difficult working conditions caused by the pandemic, he 
worked dedicatedly with the UN Secretary General, Mr. 
Guterres, so that this body of the United Nations could carry 
out its duties.  
 
I also congratulate Mr. Kőrösi on his election as the President 
of the 77th s ession of the UN General Assembly. You can count 
on the support and cooperation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 
ensuring the productive work of this body.  
 
Dear President,  
 
At the recent sessions of the General Assembly and other 
international fora, we regula rly assessed that the global order 
is experiencing tectonic changes. Today, however, we can 
conclude that the world has changed irreversibly. 
International relations that the security architecture of Europeused to rest on, as well as the wider internation al framework, 
are now a thing of the past.  
 
At a time when towns and villages in Ukraine are facing the 
terrifying reality of war, the least we can do is not to be silent 
about it. We must not be silent, especially in this building, the 
home of the United Nations, established with the aim of 
prevent ing and stopping what is currently happening in 
Ukraine. We must not be silent in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
either. We owe that to our vivid memories of the horrors of 
war and aggression.   
 
The United Nations system, was unable to prevent or stop the 
war in my country in the period between 1992 and 1995. 
Unfortunately, that happened again with Ukraine. I am 
primarily referring to the Security Council here, the body 
responsible for the protection of international peace and 
security, in light of the principles defined by the Charter of the 
United Nations.    
 
The Security Council, due to internal relations and blockades, 
is evidently unable to fulfill its obligations. However, the 
United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on 
aggression against Ukraine  by an overwhelming majority.  
 
That resolution confirmed the undisputed principles of the 
Charter of the United Nations and other acts of international 
law, which prohibit the use of armed force. It orders states to 
resolve disagreements by peaceful means.The resolution expresses support for territorial integrity and 
sovereignty of Ukraine. Unequivocally, it refers to the actions 
of the Russian Federation as aggression. It calls for the 
aggression to stop. Finally, it rejects secessionist moves of 
certai n regions within Ukraine directed against its territorial 
integrity.  
 
Bosnia and Herzegovina supported this resolution and stood 
on the right side of history, along with 140 other countries. 
This is in line with the obligations stemming from the UN 
Charte r, our previously held positions and our obligation, 
according to the Stabilization and Association Agreement, to 
follow the foreign policy of the European Union.  
 
Although this resolution does not have the power to stop the 
war, it does have the power to stop the lies. The clear and 
unambiguous language of this highest international forum 
extremely reduces the space for those who try to relativize the 
truth. The fir st step towards any solution is to tell and respect 
the truth.  
 
I hope that there will be peace, as soon as possible, so that 
people in Ukraine can live normal lives and so that the 
displaced can return to their homes.  
 
Respected President,  
 
The war in Uk raine, as well as the consequences of the 
pandemic, led to drastic changes in all spheres of life. That is 
currently very visible in a deep energy crisis, inflation, a 
general recession and the threat to supplies, especially in thefood sector. We are all facing a very difficult and challenging 
winter.  
 
Global market and international free trade enabled enormous 
progress in all corners of the world. Eradication of hunger, 
availability of consumer goods, and continuous  economic 
growth in all parts of the wo rld... those are all unquestionable 
benefits of global economic liberalization.  
 
Globalization tightly connected various parts of the globe and 
made us interdependent. Strong economic, security and 
political interrelations produced an increasingly integra ted 
global framework. Within that framework, everyone relies on 
one another in different spheres.  
 
At the same time, this interdependence of different parts of 
the world is the source of the vulnerability of our global 
community. That became obvious during by the pandemic, 
when traffic and supply channels were blocked. It is also 
obvious in the light of the current crisis, related to the war in 
Ukraine. Due to the blockade of wheat exports from Ukrainian 
ports, developing countries in Africa a nd Asia are facing 
hunger. Large part of the European continent is facing an 
energy crisis, due to dependence on Russian gas.  
 
As a result of difficulties caused by the process of political and 
economic integration, in the past years we often witnessed 
strong advocacy of political sovereignty and economic 
protectionism. Consequences of the transformation of 
developed countries from industrial to post -industrial nations, 
the migration and most recently the pandemic, lead many tocall for the construction of economic and even literal walls and 
wire fences.  
 
That is a wrong path to take. The answer to the above 
problems is not closing. The answer is the opening. The 
solution is not less cooperation. The solution is the increased 
cooperation. The answer to the e nergy crisis in Europe, caused 
by dependence on a single source, is not only relying on one's 
own forces. The answer is in diversification, in finding new, 
multiple channels of gas supply and other energy sources.  
 
No one in the modern world has enough re sources to be self -
sustainable. Past crises show that dependence on individual 
external sources is not enough either. We can only overcome 
those difficulties by increasing our international cooperation.  
 
Respected President,  
 
We live in unstable times, un precedented in recent history. As 
we face an extremely difficult winter, we are aware of the 
destabilizing potential of the current economic and energy 
crisis.  
 
20th century provides extremely valuable lessons about the 
correlation between economic crisis  and right -wing populism.  
Nazi movement came to power on the wave of great economic 
depression. That led to the greatest cataclysm in the history of 
mankind. After that, the United Nations was established, the 
UN Charter was adopted as well as the Univers al Declaration 
of Human Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and other UN acts.The essential idea of the United Nations is the idea of the 
equality of all people, regardless of their origin, skin color, 
religion, national or other affiliation. All the previously 
referenced fundamental acts of international law are based on 
this idea. Modern civilization was built on that idea.  
 
Today, almost eight decades later, we can hear voices openly 
or implicitly den ying those fundamental tenets. Right -wing 
populists more and more often say that all people and nations 
do not have equal rights, that some are more valuable than 
others. It is becoming increasingly frequent that they openly 
advocate the ideas of ethnic an d racial supremacy, and claim 
that domination and brute force are the only principles on 
which interpersonal and international relations can and 
should be structured. It only takes one step from those ideas 
to violence.  
 
From this place, from the United Na tions building, I call for 
caution and action. We will face enormous challenges in the 
coming period. We must fulfill our duty, and fight for 
civilizational ideas. At all costs, we must defend those ideas.  
  
Respected President,  
 
Bosnia and Herzegovina ha s been home to many peoples, 
cultures and religions for centuries. Our long tradition of 
multiculturalism is something we take pride in. We are proud 
of our Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Roma and other 
communities, as well as the culture of living together an dmutual respect that we have developed over the centuries. All 
those communities, individually and collectively, make the 
structure of the mosaic of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
That is the way things are and that is how things will remain.  
 
At th e same time, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a meeting place 
of cultures, was a thorn in the side of policies based on the 
idea of the impossibility of living together and the necessity of 
confrontation. Such policies led to the terrifying war in Bosnia 
and Her zegovina from 1992 to 1995. That war culminated in 
the genocide in Srebrenica.  
 
Resolutions from that period, adopted by the United Nations 
General Assembly and the Security Council, as well as the 
reports of the UN Secretary General and the judgments of the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia 
qualify the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina as an international 
armed conflict in which neighboring countries participated.  
 
The judgments passed by the Hague Criminal Tribunal 
conclude that joint criminal enterprises took place. The goal of 
those enterprises was the eliminat ion of certain ethnic groups 
from parts of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, so that 
those territories would ultimately be annexed to neighboring 
countries. This was the most serious violation of international 
general and humanitarian law.  
 
Bosnia and Herzegovina has gone through an arduous peace -
building process since the conclusion of the Dayton Peace 
Agreement However, we still face numerous challenges. Some 
of the major challenges are certain policies in Bosnia andHerzegovina and the neighborho od, which have never 
abandoned the war -time goals of dividing our country.  
 
There are parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina that are part of 
the broad wave of right -wing populism in Europe. They openly 
claim that Bosnia and Herzegovina is not sustainable, bec ause, 
according to them, it is not possible for Muslims and Christians 
to live together.  
 
Muslims  and Christians live and can live together. That life 
does have a perspective. What certainly has no perspective 
are retrograde policies that oppose such life . 
 
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a centuries -old history and is a 
living example and proof of the civilizational idea that people 
of different religions, nations and cultures can live together. 
The fact is that Bosnia and Herzegovina, even despite the war 
aimed at its destruction, managed to survive. That shows the 
exceptional resilience of my country.  
 
Majority of people in Bosnia and Herzegovina want to live in 
peace with their differences. There is enough strength for such 
Bosnia and Herzegovina to persevere. I am convinced that will 
be the case.  
 
Respected President,  
 
The experience of Bosnia and Herzegovina shows that the rule 
of law is a crucial factor of peacebuilding. The International 
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, formed by the UN, 
granted the victims the minimum of justice. It sent a messageto crim inals that their actions will not go unpunished, and that 
they will be brought to justice and face the consequences for 
their actions.  
 
Moreover, there were other international community bodies 
that made a huge contribution to the building and the 
protecti on of peace, primarily the Office of the High 
Representative and the Peace Implementation Council.  
 
 
Both of those bodies were established on the basis of Chapter 
7 of the UN Charter, which mandates the intervention of the 
international community in order  to protect peace. The 
establishment of these bodies was also confirmed by the 
relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Consequently, the 
closure of those bodies is possible only following a new 
decision of the UN Security Council. It's not time for t hat yet.  
 
Please allow me to remind you of international supervision 
that was present in some significantly developed countries, 
such as Germany, with even greater executive powers than 
the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. That supervision was ended after 45 years of 
existence, once the necessary prerequisites for that were 
created.  
 
The Office of the High Representative and the Peace 
Implementation Council have been helping domestic political 
actors to implement reforms for the past 27 years. Through 
joint efforts, we managed to unite the three once warringarmies into a single Armed Forces. We also united the three 
intelligence services, tax systems, judiciaries, etc.  
 
Thanks to those reforms and the existence of the Armed 
Forces and other state institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
even after the gradual withdrawal of 60,000 international 
troops from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the peace remained 
preserved.  
 
The past yea r brought attacks against the 27 years of 
implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement. In particular, 
there was an attempt to disband state institutions established 
on the basis of the clear provisions of the Dayton Peace 
Agreement.  
 
Thanks to the action of the Office of the High Representative 
and the Peace Implementation Council member states, led by 
the United States of America, the attack on state institutions 
was stopped and peace was preserved once again. That 
demonstrated the expediency and efficien cy of the 
international community institutions in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina.  
 
There have been requests for the closure of the Office of the 
High Representative in the past. More recently, there were 
frequent requests that the High Representative take steps t hat 
would weaken the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
introduce additional ethnic divisions. According to the Dayton 
Peace Agreement and the UN Charter, it is the obligation of 
the High Representative to protect the sovereignty andterritorial integrity  of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and not to 
contribute to its disintegration.  
 
Respected President,  
 
In addition to the civilian international presence in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, there is also the international military in the 
country, specifically the EUFOR mi ssion and the NATO 
headquarters, with a total of 1,100 troops. Bosnia and 
Herzegovina is not special in that regard. Many more 
developed sovereign states need the presence of international 
military forces, in much larger numbers than is the case in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina.  
 
The international military presence was established by the 
Dayton Peace Agreement. UN Security Council confirms the 
EUFOR mission's mandate on an annual basis.   
 
The Security Council will vote on the EUFOR mandate again in 
less than one month. It is very important for the stability of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region that  this resolution is 
adopted. However, it is important to emphasize that in any 
case, accor ding to the Dayton Peace Agreement, NATO has the 
right and obligation to deploy its forces in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina.  
 
Also, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina has made 
decisions in the past giving consent to the presence of EUFOR 
and NATO forces wi thout any time limits. Those decisions are 
a sufficient legal basis for the presence of an international 
military mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, until thePresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina takes a different 
position.  
 
Respected President,  
 
Bosnia an d Herzegovina's foreign policy goals are membership 
in the European Union and NATO.  
 
The June 2022 session of the European Council opened up the 
space for granting Bosnia and Herzegovina the status of a 
candidate for membership in the European Union, if c ertain 
conditions are met. Bosnia and Herzegovina has recently 
made certain progress in terms of fulfilling the 14 priorities 
defined in the Opinion of the European Commission on Bosnia 
and Herzegovina's application for EU membership. We fulfilled 
some of the said priorities in full, and some partially. I am 
pleased to say that, in the past weeks, we have continued 
meeting those priorities.  
 
I expect that we will continue making even more progress 
after the general elections that will take place on October 2, 
next month. I also expect Bosnia and Herzegovina to be 
granted the EU membership candidate status as soon as 
possible.  
 
Regarding our relations with NATO, Bosnia and Herzegovina is 
part of the Membership Action Plan. In terms of reforms that 
NAT O expects from us, as an aspirant country, the Presidency 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted the Reform Program, 
which is our annual obligation.Respected President,  
 
Regional cooperation is one of the foreign policy goals of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosni a and Herzegovina wants good 
relations with its neighbors, with mutual appreciation, respect 
and also the principle of reciprocity. That is the only way to 
build relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina.  
 
Everyone in our region must understand that the geostr ategic 
and geopolitical configuration of the region is completed. The 
path to security and prosperity is the path of mutual 
cooperation and solving the open issues, in accordance with 
the principles of international law.  
 
We are all equal in the region. N o one can dominate anyone 
else. We all need peace and stability.  
 
Respected President,  
 
The whole world needs peace and stability. All current 
disputes in the world should be resolved on the principles of 
international law, with the involvement of the international 
judicial institutions. That is why it is very important to 
strengthen multilat eral mechanisms and institutions. 
Therefore, I believe that the strength and authority of the UN 
as a key multilateral mechanism must be fortified.

Good morning,  
 
Mister President,  
 
• I congratulate  you, on your election, to preside over the 
77th session, of this august body, and I assure you, of my 
country’s full support, during your presidency.  
 
Mr. President,  
• At last year’s General Debate, I called on leaders, to build a better world, a planet for those living today, but more so, for those generations yet to come.  
 
• So today, I would like to take you back to 1992, when Severn Cullis -Suzuki spoke, at the U.N. Earth Summit in Rio 
de Janeiro.  
 
• She appealed to everyone, to help stop the destruction of the earth's resources.  
 
• And, now 2022, we are here.  
 
• The current state of the world, does not need, another 
wake -up call. It is time for real action!Versie nummer: 1. 5

Pagina 2 van 9 • And, while some progress, has been made, we have not 
yet been successful, in overcoming the challenges.  
   
• Meanwhile, the threats have been adding up:  
o economic recovery from the Covid- 19 pandemic 
slowed,  
o worsening climate crisis, with extreme weather events,  
o biodiversity loss and ecosystems collapse,  
o increasing levels of poverty and hunger, and  
o a humanitarian crisis.  
 
• The global community, is faced with escalating consumer 
and fuel prices, that have risen substantially, damaging living standards, particularly for the vulnerable.  
 
• Therefore, I want you, to take a moment and ask 
yourselves:  
o Have we treated our earth, in a sustainable way?  
 
o Are we better prepared for the next pandemic?  
 
o Has access to climate financing improved?  
 
o Have we addressed the root causes, for the 
humanitarian crisis, and unregulated migration?  
 
o Have we ensured that the most vulnerable in our societies, were lifted out of poverty and hunger, and have we provided for their needs?  
 
o And, are we taking enough action, together as one?Versie nummer: 1. 5

Pagina 3 van 9 Mister President,  
Secretary General,  
Colleague Heads,  
 
• We, all can conclude, that we are not  ready, and have not  
taken all the necessary measures. 
 
• And as leader of Suriname, a small country, one of only 
three, carbon -negative countries in the world, I appeal to 
you today , to let us uphold our firm commitment  to 
international principles and international law by all, when 
addressing the global challenges and threats.  
 
• Today I urge the United Nations, to exert its important role 
and place, in defense of these principles, through meaningful dialogue, and constructive engagements, as tools.  
 
• These developments, will take us further, from our shared 
objectives, in the 2030 Agenda, for Sustainable Development, and the promise of leaving no one behind.  
 Mister  President,  
• No country is immune, to the climate crisis.   
 
• Over the past months, Suriname, has been affected by 
excessive rainfall, resulting in floods in many parts of the 
country.  
 
• Due to the inflow of salt water, fertile agricultural land, 
was adversely affected, causing economic loss, and 
impacting food security, and rural livelihoods.Versie nummer: 1. 5

Pagina 4 van 9 Secretary -General , 
• During your visit to Suriname, in July this year, you 
witnessed first -hand, the impact climate change has, on 
low-lying coastal states.  
 
• You lauded our nature- based solutions, such as preserving 
mangroves, rainforest and other essential ecosystems.  
 
• And stated “the Caribbean is ground zero, for the global 
climate emergency”. 
 
Mister  President,  
• That is why it is time, to act NOW!   
• We have to deliver, on the 100 billion dollars commitment, 
in climate finance, for adaptation!

 USA_77_2022,"Remarks by President  Biden 
Before the 77th Session of the 
United Nations General  Assembly  
SEPTEMBER 21, 2022 
United Nations Headquarters  
New York, New York  
11:08 A.M. EDT 
 
THE PRESIDENT:   Thank you.  
 
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary -General, my fellow leaders, in the last year, our world has 
experienced great upheaval: a growing crisis in food insecurity; record heat, floods, and 
droughts; COVID-19; inflation; and a brutal, needless war — a war chosen by one man, to be 
very blunt.  
 
Let us speak plainly.  A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its 
neighbor, attempted to erase a sovereign state from the map.  
 
Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charter — no more 
important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbor by 
force.   
 
Again, just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless 
disregard for the responsibilities of the non- proliferati on regime.  
 
Now Russia is calling — calling up more soldiers to join the fight.  And the Kremlin isorganizing a sham referenda to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation 
of the U.N. Charter.  
 
This world should see these outrage ous acts for what they are.   Putin claims he had to act 
because Russia was threatened.   But no one threatened Russia, and no one other than Russia 
sought conflict.  
 
In fact, we warned it was coming.  And with many of you, we worked to try to avert it. 
 
Putin’s own words make his true purpose unmistakable.  Just before he invaded, Putin asserted 
— and I quote — Ukraine was “created by Russia” and never had, quote, “real statehood.” 
 
And now we see attacks on schools, railway stations, hospitals, wa- — on centers of Ukrainian 
history and culture.  
In the past, even more horrifying evidence of Russia’s atrocity and war crimes: mass graves 
uncovered in Izyum; bodies, according to those that excavated those bodies, showing signs of 
torture.   
 
This war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and 
Ukraine’s right to exist as a people.  Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, 
that should not — that should make your blood run cold. 
 
That’s why 141 nations in the General Assembly came together to unequivocally condemn 
Russia’s war against Ukraine.   The United States has marshaled massive levels of security 
assistance and humanitarian aid and direct economic support for Ukraine — more than $25 
billion to date.   
 
Our allies and partners around the world have stepped up as well.  And today, more than 40 
countries represented in here have contributed billions of their own money and equipment to helpUkraine defend itself.  
 
The United States is also working closely with  our allies and partners to impose costs on Russia, 
to deter attacks against NATO territory, to hold Russia accountable for the atrocities and war 
crimes.  
 
Because if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk 
everything this very institution stands for.  Everything. 
 
Every victory won on the battlefield belongs to the courageous Ukrainian soldiers.  But this past 
year, the world was tested as well, and we did not hesitate.  
 
We chose liberty.   We chose sovereignty .  We chose principles to which every party to the 
United Nations Charter is beholding.  We stood with Ukraine. 
 
Like you, the United States wants this war to end on just terms, on terms we all signed up for: 
that you cannot seize a nation’s territory by f orce.   The only country standing in the way of that 
is Russia.   
 
So, we — each of us in this body who is determined to uphold the principles and beliefs we 
pledge to defend as members of the United Nations — must be clear, firm, and unwavering in 
our resol ve.  
 
Ukraine has the same rights that belong to every sovereign nation.  We will stand in solidarity 
with Ukraine.  We will stand in solidarity against Russia’s aggression.  Period. 
 
Now, it’s no secret that in the contest between democracy and autocracy, the United States — 
and I, as President — champion a vision for our world that is grounded in the values of 
democracy.The United States is determined to defend and strengthen democracy at home and around the 
world.  Because I believe democracy remains humanity’s greatest instrument to address the 
challenges of our time.   
 
We’re working with the G7 and likeminded countries to prove democracies can deliver for their 
citizens but also deliver for the rest of the world as well.   
 
But as we meet today, the U .N. Charter — the U.N. Charter’s very basis of a stable and just rule-
based order is under attack by those who wish to tear it down or distort it for their own political 
advantage.   
 
And the United Nations Charter was not only signed by democracies of the world, it was 
negotiated among citizens of dozens of nations with vastly different histories and ideologies, 
united in their commitment to work for peace.  
 
As President Truman said in 1945, the U.N. Charter — and I quote — is “proof that nations, like 
men, can state their differences, can face them, and then can find common ground on which to 
stand.”  End of quote. 
 
That common ground was so straightforward, so basic that, today, 193 of you — 193 member 
states — have willingly embraced its principles.   And standing up for those principles for the 
U.N. Charter is the job of every responsible member state.  
 
I reject the use of violence and war to conquer nations or expand borders through bloodshed. 
 
To stand against global politics of fear and coercion; to defend the sovereign rights of smaller 
nations as equal to those of larger ones; to embrace basic principles like freedom of navigation, 
respect for international law, and arms control — no matter what else we may disagree on, that is 
the common ground upon which we must stand.If you’re still committed to a strong foundation for the good of every nation around the world, 
then the United States wants to work with you.  
 
I also believe the time has come for this institution to become more inclusive so that it can better 
respond to the needs of today’s world. 
 
Members of the U.N. Security Council, including the United States, should consistently uphold 
and defend the U.N. Charter and refrain — refrain from the use of the veto, except in rare, 
extraordinary situations, to ensure that the Council remains credible and effective. 
 
That is also why the United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and non-
permanent representatives of the Council.  This includes permanent seats for those nations we’ ve 
long supported and permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. 
 
The United States is committed to this vital work.   In every region, we pursued new, constructive 
ways to work with partners to advance shared interests, from elevating the Quad in the Indo-
Pacific; to signing the Los Angeles Declaration of Migration and Protection at the Summit of the 
Americas; to joining a historic meeting of nine Arab leaders to work toward a more peaceful, 
integrated Middle East; to hosting  the U.S.- Africa Leaders’ Summit in — this December.  
 
As I said last year, the United States is opening an era of relentless diplomacy to address the 
challenges that matter most to people’s lives — all people’s lives: tackling the climate crisis, as 
the previous spoker [sic] — speaker spoke to; strengthening global health security; feeding the 
world — feeding the world. 
 
We made that priority.   And one year later, we’re keeping that promise. 
 
From the day I came to office, we’ve led with a bold climate agenda.   We rejoined the Paris 
Agreement, convened major climate summits, helped deliver critical agreements on 
COP26.  And we helped get two thirds of the world GDP on track to limit warming to 1.5degrees Celsius.   
 
And now I’ve signed a historic piece of le gislation here in the United States that includes the 
biggest, most important climate commitment we have ever made in the history of our country: 
$369 billion toward climate change.  That includes tens of billions in new investments in 
offshore wind and solar, doubling down on zero emission vehicles, increasing energy efficiency, 
supporting clean manufacturing. 
 
Our Department of Energy estimates that this new law will reduce U.S. emissions by one gigaton 
a year by 2030 while unleashing a new era of clean-energy-powered economic growth. 
 
Our investments will also help reduce the cost of developing clean energy technologies 
worldwide, not just the United States.  This is a global gamechanger — and none too soon.  We 
don’t have much time. 
 
We all know we’re al ready living in a climate crisis.   No one seems to doubt it after this past 
year.   We meet — we meet — much of Pas- — as we meet, much of Pakistan is still underwater; 
it needs help.  Meanwhile, the Horn of Africa faces unprecedented drought.  
 
Families ar e facing impossible choices, choosing which child to feed and wondering whether 
they’ll survive. 
 
This is the human cost of climate change.  And it’s growing, not lessening. 
 
So, as I announced last year, to meet our global responsibility, my administration is working with 
our Congress to deliver more than $11 billion a year to international climate finance to help 
lower -income countries implement their climate goals and ensure a just energy transition.  
 
The key part of that will be our PEPFAR  [PREPARE] pla n, which will help half a billion people, 
and especially vulnerable countries, adapt to the impacts of climate change and build resilience.This need is enormous.  So let this be the moment we find within ourselves the will to turn back 
the tide of climate demastation [sic] — devastation and unlock a resilient, sustainable, clean 
energy economy to preserve our planet. 
 
On global health, we’ve delivered more than 620 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to 116 
countries around the world, with more available to help meet countries’ needs — all free of 
charge, no strings attached. 
 
And we’re working closely with the G20 and other countries.  And the United States helped lead 
the change to establish a groundbreaking new Fund for Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and 
Response at the World Bank. 
 
At the same time, we’ve continued to advance the ball on enduring global health challenges. 
 
Later today, I’ll host the Seventh Replenishment Conference for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis, and Malaria.  With bipartisan support in our Congress, I have pledged to contribute 
up to $6 billion to that effort. 
 
So I look forward to welcoming a historic round of pledges at the conference resulting in one of 
the largest global health fundraisers ever held in all of history. 
 
We’re also taking on the food crisis head on.  With as many as 193 million people around the 
world experiencing acute — acute food insecurity — a jump of 40 million in a year — today I’m 
announcing another $2.9 billion in U.S. support for lifesaving humanitarian and food security 
assistance for this year alone.  
 
Russia, in the meantime, is pumping out lies, trying to pin the blame for the crisis — the food 
crisis — onto sanctions imposed by many in the world for the aggression against Ukraine.So le t me be perfectly clear about something: Our sanctions explicitly allow — explicitly allow 
Russia the ability to export food and fertilizer.  No limitation.   It’s Russia’s war that is worsening 
food insecurity, and only Russia can end it. 
 
I’m grateful for the work here at the U.N. — including your leadership, Mr. Secretary- General 
— establishing a mechanism to export grain from Black Sea ports in Ukraine that Russia had 
blocked for months, and we need to make sure it’s extended. 
 
We believe strongly in the need to feed the world.  That’s why the United States is the world’s 
largest supporter of the World Food Programme, with more than 40 percent of its budget. 
 
We’re leading support — we’re leading support of the UNICEF efforts to feed children around 
the w orld.  
 
And to take on the larger challenge of food insecurity, the United States introduced a Call to 
Action: a roadmap eliminating global food insecurity — to eliminating global food insecurity 
that more than 100 nation member states have already support ed. 
 
In June, the G7 announced more than $4.5 billion to strengthen food security around the world. 
 
Through USAID’s Feed the Future initiative, the United States is scaling up innovative ways to 
get drought- and heat-resistant seeds into the hands of farmers who need them, while distributing 
fertilizer and improving fertilizer efficiency so that farmers can grow more while using less.  
 
And we’re calling on all countries to refrain from banning food exports or hoarding grain while 
so many people are suffering.  Because in every country in the world, no matter what else 
divides us, if parents cannot feed their children, nothing — nothing else matters if parents cannot 
feed their children.  
 
As we look to the future, we’re working with our partners to update and create rules of the roadfor new challenges we face in the 21st century. 
 
We launched the Trade and Technology Council with the European Union to ensure that key 
technologies — key technologies are developed and governed in the way that benefits everyone.  
 
With our partner countries and through the U.N., we’re supporting and strengthening the norms 
of responsibility — responsible state behavior in cyberspace and working to hold accountable 
those who use cyberattacks to threaten international peace and security.  
 
With partners in the Americas, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, and the Indo- Pacific, we’re 
working to build a new economic ecosystem while — where every nation — every nation gets a 
fair shot and economic growth is resilient, sustainable, and shared.  
 
That’s why the United States has championed a global minimum tax.  And we will work to see it 
implemented so major corporations pay their fair share everywhere — everywhere.  
 
It’s also been the idea behind the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, w hich the United States 
launched this year with 13 other Indo- Pacific economies.   We’re working with our partners in 
ASEAN and the Pacific Islands to support a vision for a critical Indo- Pacific region that is free 
and open, connected and prosperous, secure and resilient.  
 
Together with partners around the world, we’re working to ser- — secure resilient supply chains 
that protect everyone from coercion or domination and ensure that no country can use energy as 
a weapon.  
 
And as Russia’s war rolls [sic] — ril es the global economy, we’re also calling on major global 
creditors, including the non-Paris Club countries, to transparently negotiate debt forgiveness for 
lower -income countries to forestall broader economic and political crises around the world.  
 
Inste ad of infrastructure projects that generate huge and large debt without delivering on thepromised advantages, let’s meet the enormous infrastructure needs around the world with 
transparent investments — high-standard projects that protect the rights of workers and the 
environment — keyed to the needs of the communities they serve, not to the contributor. 
 
That’s why the United States, together with fellow G7 partners, launched a Partnership for 
Global Infrastructure and Investment.   We intend to collectively mobilize $600 billion 
in investment through this partnership by 2027.  
 
Dozens of projects are already underway: industrial- scale vaccine manufacturing in Senegal, 
transformative solar projects in Angola, first-of- its-kind small modular nuclear power plant in 
Romania.  
 
These are investments that are going to deliver returns not just for those countries, but for 
everyone.  The United States will work with every nation, including our competitors, to solve 
global problems like climate change.   Climate diplo macy is not a favor to the United States or 
any other nation, and walking away hurts the entire world. 
 
Let me be direct about the competition between the United States and China.  As we manage 
shifting geopolitical trends, the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader.   We do 
not seek conflict.  We do not seek a Cold War.   We do not ask any nation to choose between the 
United States or any other partner.  
 
But the United States will be unabashed in promoting our vision of a free, open, secure, and 
prosperous world and what we have to offer communities of nations: investments that are 
designed not to foster dependency, but to alleviate burdens and help nations become self-
sufficient; partnerships not to create political obligation, but because we know our own success 
— each of our success is increased when other nations succeed as well.  
 
When individuals have the chance to live in dignity and develop their talents, everyone 
benefits.   Critical to that is living up to the highest goals of this institution: increasing peace andsecurity for everyone, everywhere.  
 
The United States will not waver in our unrelenting determination to counter and thwart the 
continuing terrorist threats to our world.  And we will lead with our diplomacy to strive for 
peaceful resolution of conflicts.  
 
We seek to uphold peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.  
 
We remain committed to our One China policy, which has helped prevent conflict for four 
decades.   And we continue to oppose unilateral changes in the status quo by either side.  
 
We support an African Union-led peace process to end the fight in Ethiopia and restore security 
for all its people.   
 
In Venezuela, where years of the political oppression have driven more than 6 million people 
from that country, we urge a Venezuelan -led dialogue and a return to free and fair elections. 
 
We continue to stand with our neighbor in Haiti as it faces political-fueled gang violence and an 
enormous human crisis. 
 
And we call on the world to do the same.  We have more to do.  
 
We’ll continue to back the U.N.-mediated truce in Yemen, which has delivered precious months 
of peace to people that have suffered years of war.  
 
And we will continue to advocate for lasting negotiating peace between the Jewish and 
democratic state of Israel and the Palestinian people.   The United States is committed to Israel’s 
security, full stop.  And a negotiated two-state solution remains, in our view, the best way to 
ensure Israel’s security and prosperity for the future and give the Palestinians the state which — 
to which they are entitled — both sides to fully respect the equal rights of their citizens; bothpeople enjoying equal measure of freedom and dignity. 
 
Let me also urge every nation to recommit to strengthening the nuclear non- prolifer ation regime 
through diplomacy.  No matter what else is happening in the world, the United States is ready to 
pursue critical arms control measures.   A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.  
 
The five permanent members of the Security Council just reaffirmed that commitment in 
January.  But today, we’re seeing disturbing trends.  Russia shunned the Non- Proliferati - — -
Proliferation ideals embraced by every other nation at the 10th NPT Review Conference.  
 
And again, today, as I said, they’re making irresponsible nuclear threats to use nuclear 
weapons.  China is conducting an unprecedented, concerning nuclear buildup without any 
transparency.   
 
Despite our efforts to begin serious and sustained diplomacy, the Democratic People’s Republic 
of Kore a continues to blatantly violate U.N. sanctions. 
 
And while the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
Action if Iran steps up to its obligations, the United States is clear: We will not allow Iran to 
acquire a nuclear weapon.  
 
I continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome.  The 
nonproliferation regime is one of the greatest successes of this institution.  We cannot let the 
world now slide backwards, nor can we turn a blind eye to the erosion of human rights. 
 
Perhaps singular among this body’s achievements stands the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, which is the standard by which our forebears challenged us to measure ourselves. 
 
They made clear in 1948: Human rights are the basi s for all that we seek to achieve.   And yet 
today, in 2022, fundamental freedoms are at risk in every part of our world, from the violationsof — in Xinjiang detailed in recent reports by the Office of U.N. — U.S. — reports detailing by 
the U.S.  [U.N.] Hig h Commissioner, to the horrible abuses against pro- democracy activists and 
ethnic minorities by the military regime in Burma, to the increased repression of women and 
girls by the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
And today, we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are 
demonstrating to secure their basic rights. 
 
But here’s what I know: The future will be won by those countries that unleash the full potential 
of their populations, where women and girls can exercise equal rights, including basic 
reproductive rights, and contribute fully to building a stronger economies and more resilient 
societies; where religious and ethnic minorities can live their lives without harassment and 
contribute to the fabric of their communities; where the LGBTQ+ community individuals live 
and love freely without being targeted with violence; where citizens can question and criticize 
their leaders without fear of reprisal.  
 
The United States will always promote human rights and the values enshrined in the U.N. 
Charter in our own country and around the world. 
 
Let me end with this: This institution, guided by the U.N. Charter and the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, is at its core an act of dauntless hope. 
Let me say that again: It’s an act of dauntless hope. 
 
Think about the vision of those first delegates who undertook a seemingly impossible task while 
the world was still smoldering.  
 
Think about how divided the people of the world must have felt with the fresh grief of millions 
dead, the genocidal horrors of the Holocaust exposed.They had every right to believe only the worst of humanity.  Instead, they reached for what was 
best in all of us, and they strove to build something better: enduring peace; comity among 
nations; equal rights for every member of the human family; cooperation for the advancement of 
all humankind. 
 
My fellow leaders, the challenges we face today are great indeed, but our capacity is 
greater.   Our commitment must be greater still.  
So let’s stand together to again declare the unmistakable resolve that nations of the world are 
united still, that we stand for the values of the U.N. Charter, that we still believe by working 
together we can bend the arc of history toward a freer and more just world for all our children, 
although none of us have fully achieved it. 
We’re not passive witnesses to history; we are the authors of history. 
 
We can do this — we have to do it — for ourselves and for our future, for humankind. 
Thank you for your tolerance, for listening to me.  I appreciate it very much.  God bless you 
all.  (Applause.)

77. sesija s atklāšanā Ņujorkā 21.septembrī

Interlocking Challenges”  
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
 
Mr President, excellencies, distinguished 
delegates!  
 
1. Let me congratulate you, Mr Csaba Kőrösi, 
on taking office as  President of the 77th 
session of the UN General Assembly. I 
confirm Latvia's readiness to cooperate 
constructively  with you .  
 
2. Our agenda is full and still growing . To quote 
George Orwell: ‘’Contrary to popular belief, 
 
 the past was not more eventful than the 
present’’.    
 
3. Let me focus  today  on a few fundamental  
themes  – Russia’s war against  Ukraine and 
international law ; sustainable development  
and climate change;  and digital security.  
 
4. First, the upholding of international law . 
    
5. International law is the basis for the world 
peace order established by the United 
Nations Charter.  
 
6. At the core of this or der is respect for the 
sovereignty of states and prohibition of the 
 
 use of force . Starting a war of aggression is 
the gravest threat  to our world peace order.   
 
7. Nevertheless,  seven  months now Russia has 
been  waging an unprovoked  and unjustified  
war against a sovereign UN Member State  - 
Ukraine.  
 
8. Let me stress : This is not just a regional  
security issu e.   
 
9. Russia's military aggression against Ukraine 
threatens global  security and stability .  
 
10.  In the 21st century, Russia maintains a  19th 
century  ideology of imperialism , colonialism  
and racism . 
 
  
11. Russia invaded Georgia  in 2008 .  It illegally 
annexed Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014. It has 
used increasing ly aggressive rhetoric 
towards  other neighbouring countries .  
These are all manifestations of its 
imperialistic and colonial ambitions.   
 
12. Denying another nation ’s right to exist, 
promoting the idea of supremacy of 
Russian s and their special missionary role in 
the world – these are all  contemporary 
expressions of racism.   
 
13. That is exactly the opposite of what the UN 
stands for. 
 
  
 
Mr President, dear colleagues!  
 
14. Russia's war in Ukraine has caused a 
humanitarian disaster. A third of the 
population ha s been forced to leave their 
homes.  
 
 
15.  Russia  is preventing Ukrainian -grown food 
from reaching the world market . Also, Russia 
uses its position in the energy market to 
exert pressure. High energy prices maintain 
high levels of global inflation, which most 
dramatically affects the world's most 
vulnerable populations. 
 
    
16. Russia continues to spread false narrative s 
about the cause of the global crisis in food, 
fuel, and finances . These lies  must be 
overturned.  Russia alone is responsible  for 
this crisis !  
 
 
Mr President!  
 
 
17. We, the law -abiding Member States of the 
UN, are responsible for supporting Ukraine’s 
self-defence and stopping the aggressor.  
 
18. Russia's ability to finance the war against 
Ukraine must be limited . Global sanctions in 
 
 the fields of finance, trade, transport and 
energy, as well as restrictive measures 
against individuals and legal entities,  must 
be maintained and strengthened .  
 
19.  Belarus, being equally responsible for 
enabling  Russia's military aggression against 
Ukraine , is also being sanctioned.  
 
20.  Since the beginning of the war, Latvia  has 
spent over 0.8% of its GDP on military, 
economic, financial and humanitarian aid to 
Ukraine .   We stand with the brave people of 
Ukraine !  
 
Mr President , distinguished delegates ! 
 
 21. The heroic defence mounted by the people 
of Ukraine  is bringing success .  Today we 
learn tha t partial mobilization  has been 
declared in Russia , as their once -mighty 
army is overwhelmed. The ‘ blitzkrieg ’ 
envisaged by President Putin has turned into 
a long  nightmare .   
22.  In another sign of desperation, Russia 
plans to hold illegal referenda  in the coming 
days on the annexation of the occupied 
territories  of Donetsk and Luhansk  to the 
Russian Federation.    
23. This is a blatant contravention of both 
Ukrainian and international law .  Latvia will 
not recognize the legitimacy of these 
referenda and their results .  I call on the 
international community to do likewise. 
 
  
 
Mr President , dear colleagues!  
 
24. Impunity  means invitation to further crimes.  
 
25. Therefore , the aggressor  must be held 
accountable .  
 
26. The International Court of Justice and the 
International Criminal Court ha ve already 
started proceeding s on particular aspects of 
Russia’s  war against Ukraine .  The European 
Court of Human Rights has also initiated 
proceedings. 
 
 27. However, a legal gap remains .  No 
international court has jurisdiction over the 
main issue – the starting of a war of 
aggression, the gravest viola tion of the 
Charter of United Nations and in ternational  
law. 
 
28. Therefore, I call for the establishment of a 
Special Tribunal.   
 
29. The main task of the Special Tribunal would 
be to investigate the responsibility of the 
Russian state in the crime of aggression.   
 
30. After the war , Russia will have to pay 
reparations to  Ukraine  for damage s. The 
 
 Special Tribunal  could be part of an 
international reparations mechanism . 
 
 
31. The Special Tribunal could be established 
on the basis of a Resolution of the General 
Assembly, by another international 
organisation or a group of likeminded states.  
 
 
 
Mr President,  
 
32. Let me now turn to  sustainable 
development and climate change . 
 
 33. Agenda 2030 is a common road map for 
overcoming our challenges  and creating 
future -oriented, sustainable and inclusive 
policies .  
 
34. This year, Latvia submitted  to the UN  its 
second progress report on Sustainable 
Development Goals, highlighting the areas 
of e ducation, gender equality, youth 
participation and international cooperation.  
 
35. The implementation of Agenda 2030 is also 
the overarching goal of Latvia's 
development cooperation policy.  
 
36. Over the past 30 years  Latvia has developed 
expertise in democratic processes, good 
 
 governance, socio -economic changes and 
gender equality.  Good governance, 
especially strengthening of the rule of law 
and democracy, accounts for more than 40% 
of all support provided by Latvia.  As a 
member of the Peacebuilding Commission 
we are sharing our expertise  on societal 
resilience.  
 
37. Joint efforts must also be continued to 
address the consequences of climate 
change , including through development 
cooperation efforts . For example, in Central 
Asia, we have been working with the 
promotion of clean technologies. 
 
 38. Particularly related to the protection of the 
climate is the problem of global justice .   
Latvia supports the view that the greatest 
polluters should also bear a greater burden 
for the protection of the climate.  Latvia 
consequently advocates for more justice and 
solidarity on the global agenda.  
 
 
Mr President,  
 
39.    We are convinced that digitization is one 
of the most important agents of change. 
Latvia supports innovative and proven 
digital solutions that promote the efficiency 
of public administration, public participation 
 
 in decision -making and the creation of new 
economic opportunities.  
 
40. Let me now highlight security and 
fundamental rights in the digital space.  
 
41. The digital space is an integral part of our 
lives. It has enormous potential to contribute 
to the  sustainable development of nations. 
Therefore, we must resist attempts to turn 
the digital space into a battlefield, where 
international law is challenged and basic 
rights are ignored . 
 
42. Use of people's data in ways incompatible 
with human dignity, rights and security  must 
be prevented . 
 
  
43. The global Internet must be open, free, 
reliable and secure ! 
 
44. We support the proposal of the UN 
Secretary General  to agree on a Global 
Digital Compact , which should reduce  the 
digital gap between developed and 
developing countries.  
. 
45. Both the Covid pandemic and current 
geopolitical challenges highlight the need to 
strengthen the resilience of society  by 
combating disinformation, promoting 
media literacy and strengthening media 
freedom. 
 
 46. Accordingly, Latvia is actively preparing for 
the upcoming 11th Global Media & 
Information Literacy week .  Critical thinking 
skills  build our  immunity  to disinformation . 
 
47. Mr President, distinguished delegates,  
 
48. The aggression by a permanent member of 
the UN Security Council against another UN 
Member State undermines the basic 
principles of the multilateral system that we 
have been building for decades.  
 
49. This situation once again confirms that a 
meaningful reform of the UN Securit y 
Council is necessary. 
 
 50. As a first-time candidate for  the Security 
Council in the 2025 elections, Latvia takes 
the responsibilities of  membership  very 
seriously .  We will  strive to make the Security 
Council  more effective , accountable, 
coherent  and transparent.  Latvia supports a 
more just, equitable representation by 
Member States, notably from Africa.  
 
Mr President,  
 
51. The Baltic states have much to contribute to 
the work of the UN.  
 
52.  For us, t he horrors of war, occupation and 
harsh rule by a colonial  power  are within 
living memory.  So is the fight for liberty and 
 
 restored independence,  and the transition to 
a successful, sustainable economy  and the 
rule of law.   
 
53. We have no wish to dominate o r intimidate 
anyone. We reject the idea of spheres of 
influence. As smaller states , we have an 
existential interest in  effective  
multilateralism.   
 
54. Therefore , Latvia will continue to contribute 
to the work of the United Nations  in the 
spirit of optimism and determination.  
 
Thank you!", LVA,2022

 Statement by H.E. Maia Sandu, President of the 
Republic of Moldova, delivered at the General Debate 
of the 77th Session of the United Nations’ General 
Assembly High -Level Week  
21 September 2022  
 
Mr. President,  
Mr. Secretary -General,  
Your excellences,  
 
I am standing before you today proudly representing the 
Republic of Moldova, a future member of the European 
Union . 
I am grateful for the unanimous support that we 
received from the 27 EU member states. Thank you for 
your recognition and vote of trust in our l ove for 
freedom, dynamic democracy, and commitment to the 
rule of law.   
A successful peace project, the European Union – 
through cooperation and integration – was forged to 
stop the cycle of wars that tormented our continent for 
centuries. This is another  watershed moment in our 
history, and the EU has to do it again. 
 By applying to join the European Union, we want the 
world to know: we choose democracy over autocracy, 
liberty over oppression, peace over war, and prosperity 
over poverty.  
The EU candidate s tatus gives us hope, a clear sense of 
direction, a unifying goal, an anchor, and a strong sense 
of belonging. Belonging to the free world.  
 
Ladies and gentlemen,  
One year ago, none of us here would have imagined 
a major war in Europe.  
Russia’s unprovoked  war against another sovereign 
state, Ukraine, has shaken the world to the core, has put 
to test the fundamental principles of the UN, has 
shattered global security, triggered a European energy 
crisis, global food shortages, and an economic 
downturn.  
Seve n months of bombings have killed thousands of 
innocent people and pushed millions of Ukrainians to 
flee their homes.  
This war is not just an attack on our neighbour and 
friend, Ukraine. It is an attack on the rules -based 
international order. It is an attac k on nuclear safety. 
 It is an attack on food supplies to countries in the 
Middle East and Africa.  
It’s an attack on this very institution  where we find 
ourselves in today. We firmly condemn  the war against 
Ukraine, as well as the recently announced additional 
mobilization of troops by Russia.  
We firmly stand with Ukraine and support its 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity 
within its internationally recognized borders.  
I would like to express my utmost admiration to all 
Ukrainians for their courage, their resilience, and their 
inner power to continue this fight for survival, justice, 
and freedom.  
It is our moral duty, as an international community, to 
continue supporting Uk raine. Ukraine is fighting today 
to keep all of us safe, to keep Europe safe. It needs our 
back and support. Europe, all of us, we must help 
Ukraine.  
As I stand at this tribune I represent a country that 
wants peace . I represent the citizens of Moldova w ho, 
irrespective of the language that we speak - Romanian, 
Ukrainian, Russian, Gagauz, or Bulgarian -, regardless 
of our ethnicity, or political preferences, whether we 
 live on the right bank of river Nistru, or in the 
breakaway region of Transnistria, we a ll want peace !  
A country of less than 3 million people, we have 
sheltered  more than half a million refugees fleeing the 
war. At the peak of the inflow, our population grew by 
4 percent. Some 80,000 refugees chose to stay among 
us.   
I use this opportunity  to pay tribute from this high 
rostrum  to all Moldovan families who showed 
unprecedented solidarity with refugees by opening their 
homes and hearts to those in need. I am proud of my 
people.   
I am also grateful to the international partners, 
including the United Nations, who have provided 
assistance in managing the humanitarian crisis.  
I also thank the UN Secretary -General and other high -
level officials who visited our country in our hour of 
need, to show support and solidarity.  
My deep gratitude goes to France, Germany, Romania 
and other partners for setting up the Moldova Support 
Platform that stands by our country in these difficult 
times. 
 Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Moldova knows what it is to be a country divided by 
conflict. In 1992 we faced a brief but tragic war in the 
Transnistrian region of our country.  
Three decades later, we are still trying to overcome the 
consequences of that conflict, and reintegrate our 
country. The only way to achi eve this is through 
peaceful dialogue and respect for our sovereignty and 
territorial integrity.   
As Russia has launched its war against Ukraine, we 
have worked harder than ever to maintain peace on both 
banks of river Nistru.  
We have done our best to en sure that all citizens of 
Moldova, including those residing in the breakaway 
region, continue to enjoy peace.  
The illegal presence of the Russian military troops in 
the Transnistrian region infringes our neutrality and 
increases the security risks for our  country.  
We call on the complete and unconditional 
withdrawal of Russian troops . We call on the 
destruction of ammunition from the Cobasna stockpiles, 
which pose a security and environmental threat to the 
region as a whole. 
 As we strive to maintain  peace, our economy and 
society are bearing the brunt of Russia’s war against 
Ukraine. Our resources are strained, investments have 
slowed down, trade and transport routes are disrupted, 
inflation is nearing 35 percent.  
In addition, we are facing a wide s pectrum of hybrid 
threats, from disinformation and propaganda to cyber -
attacks and energy pressures.   
The abnormally high prices for natural gas and Russia’s 
attempts to weaponize gas and oil supplies to Europe 
have triggered an unprecedented energy crisi s. We are 
one of the most vulnerable countries in the face of this 
crisis.  
But this only makes us more determined to diversify 
our energy sources and decrease dependence on fossil 
fuels. We plan to increase the share of renewable 
electricity supplies from  3 to 30 percent in the next 3 
years. This will make our country stronger, and our 
environment healthier and safer.    
 
Distinguished audience,  
We all know that the only way to save the planet is joint 
global action against climate change. The same goes fo r 
the fight against corruption. 
 Corruption weakens states and erodes democracies. We 
should take it more seriously than ever before. We need 
clear international mechanisms to stop the flow of dirty 
money. We need better instruments for asset recovery 
and restitution.  
We need better information exchanges between law 
enforcement and anti -fraud authorities in different 
countries. And we need to set up international sanction 
regimes against corruption.  
 
Ladies and gentlemen,  
Despite all challenges, Moldova is pressing ahead 
with our reform agenda. We are building a stronger, 
and more democratic state. Last year, Moldova 
improved 49 positions in the Press Freedom Index, 
ranking 40th in the world.  Justice reform and the fight 
against corruption is at the core of our transformation.  
We are working hard to become a better place for 
investors – to create jobs, boost the economy and bring 
greater prosperity to our people.  
We are investing in connectivity with Europe and we 
are tryi ng to bring our country closer to European 
standards. 
 We are building roads and bridges, hospitals and a more 
modern education system. We are building stronger 
institutions that will benefit the citizens of Moldova.  
We are focused, persistent and relentl ess. We are 
determined to bring Moldova into the EU so that every 
Moldovan can have better living standards and more 
economic opportunities, at home.  
This is the only way for Moldova to grow as a 
consolidated democracy in our part of the world, during 
these difficult times.  
 
Ladies and gentlemen,  
As I come before you from a region weakened by war, 
an energy crisis, drought and rampant inflation, my 
message is this: in the face of man -made human 
suffering and economic adversity, the countries of the 
world must stand together once again .  
We must do so to reaffirm the value of peace and the 
inviolability of human life, to defend democracy and 
freedom, and to uphold the right of every country to 
decide their own fate.  
Thank you.", MDA,2022

STATEMENT BY HIS EXCELLENCY DR. HAGE G. GEINGOB, 
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF NAMIBIA AT THE 77th 
SESSION OF THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
SEPTEMBER 2 1, 2022 NEW YORK  
(Check Against Delivery) Mr. President,  
Your Excellencies, Heads of State and 
Government,  
Mr. Ant ónio Guterres, Secretary -General of the 
United Nations , 
Distinguished Delegates, 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
  Namibia congratulates H.E  Csaba Kőrösi on 
your  election as President of the 77
th Session 
of this august Assembly. Please be assured of  
Namibia ’s full support as y ou provide leadership during your tenure. Allow me to also 
extend appreciation to your predecessor H.E 
Abdullah Shahid for his sterling stew ardship  as 
President of the 76th Session of  the General 
Assembly.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Since attaining our political independence, 32 
years ago, we are  proud of the work we  have 
undertake n towards the second phase of our 
struggle for economic independence. During 
this period we have bui lt a strong foundation for our Governance A rchitecture with emphasis 
on strengthening processes, systems and 
institutions . Given these advances  in Effective 
Governance , we are  optimistic in our quest to 
deal with the triple challenges of inequality, 
unemployment and  poverty . Our impact plan, 
the Harambee Prosperity Plan II, which is 
accelerating the implementation of the 
National Development Plans is fastracking our 
efforts towards Vision 2030.  
 
Since my term of office is com ing to an end on 
20 March 2025 - as a nation country with a Constituion that binds the Head of State to two 
term-limits, we have set in motion a process 
for an orderly succession  to continue with our 
peaceful development . The Ruling SWAPO 
Party , of which I  am the Head  is cur rently 
conducting primaries. There is a real possibility 
that the next candidate of the SWAPO Party  for 
the National  Presidential elections will be  a 
woman or a young male , of whom  the male is 
from a generation that was not in exile. The 
presence of women in the line of succession is 
a demonstration of the strides we have made 
in gender equality, with women representation at over 40% in the National Assembly. 
Moreover, 90% of our ba nks are helmed by 
women.  
 
Namibia is a child of international solidarity, 
midwifed by the United Nations. T herefore, we 
are convinced about  solidarity and partnership  
as critical enablers of our developmental aspirations.  
 
Allow me at this juncture to thank the 
Secretary General for his comprehensive  
Report on  Our Common Agenda , which carries clear recommendations on how to advance the 
SDGs and all existing global agreements  
through multilateralism, with the UN at the 
center of our efforts. I commend  the Secretary 
General , for his visionary leadership in 
proposing that we  should  meet in a Summit of 
the Future  to reflect on challenges and 
opportunities that await current and future  
generations . Namibia supports the convening  
of this important  Summit at the earliest 
opportune time. Over the past few months , it has been 
encouraging to note  the concerted efforts to 
shed a spotlight on Transforming Education 
and advancing SDG 4. Education is a sector 
that Namibia has consistently been prioriti sing 
through the allocation of resources (both 
human and financial) and the consistent prioritisation  of policy development.  In the 
context of the recently concluded 
Transformation of Education Summit, Namibia 
commits to  transformativ e leadership, 
ensuring access to inclusive digital 
technologies and developing a strategy for innovati ve financing  and resource 
mobilisaiton.  
 
In Namibia, t he education sector receives the 
largest share of budgetary support , equivalent 
to 8%  of GDP and almost a quarter of the total 
national budget. The Namibian G overnment 
offers free prima ry and secondary education , 
which demonstrates  our commitment to 
prioritizing and expanding access to education 
for all. Furthermore , we are proud of the recent 
landing of the Google Equ iano subsea cable 
which lends itself greatly to changing 
Namibia’s digital transformation landscape 
and narrowing our digital divide, in line with 
our commitment to leverag ing the 4th 
Industrial Revolution. In Namibia, we have set 
up the Fourth Industrial Revolution  Task Force, 
which recently made recommendations as to 
how Namibia can strengthen domestic 
capabilities to derive optimal gains  from  the 4th 
Industrial Revolution. In line with the recommendations of the Task Force, the Government is currently developing a 
consolidated national 4IR strategy to provide 
overarching direction and multi -sectoral 
plann ing. The strategy will prioritiz e education 
reform to close the 4IR skills gap, cybersecurity and the expansion of ICT 
infrastructure and services.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Global debt is  at an unprecedented level  and 
interest rates are rising . This reality limit s our fiscal space. As we talk about our collective 
aspirations , we should remain acutely aware of 
the vulnerabilities  facing developing countries . 
Namibia’s classification as an Upper Middle -
Income Country, presents challenges with 
regards to mobilizing re sources to finance our 
development goals.  As I have been saying, 
taking our GDP and dividing  it by our small 
population, thus de riving a high per capita 
income  is without doubt a flawed formula that 
requires urgent consideration. The formula does not take into account the vast income 
disparities between the wealthy  white and the poor  black , which  is a consequence of 100 
years of colonialism and Apartheid occupation.  
However , I am pleased to hear that  a number 
of developi ng and developed countries are in 
agreement with this unfair classification, 
which denies countries like Namibia access to 
soft loans and grants, which are necessary to 
fight inequality and to lift many out of poverty .  
 The choice of the theme for this Se ssion 
“Solutions through solidarity, sustainability 
and science”  calls on us to deal with the issues 
that affect us all. Therefore, I am confident that the unfair classification of countries like 
Namibia as upper middle-income countries will 
enjoy priority .  
Mr. President,  
Over the past few months, we have  witnessed 
stark geopolitical tensions, a reminder of the 
fragility of our world order. Threats to peace 
and security come at a great cost  to the men, 
women and children trapped in such 
situations. The Russia- Ukraine conflict  is now 
in its 7th mon th, with serious consequences for  
food and energy supply chains . Namibia 
believes that d ialogue is the condition sine qua non for the peaceful resolution of any conflict. 
Our United Nations was created for the 
maintenance of peace and security,  and should 
lead a  peaceful resolution in the  Russia -
Ukraine conflict .  
Namibia, as a member of the AU Peace and 
Security Council and Chair of the SADC Organ 
on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation; 
continues to demonstrate its commitment to 
regional and continental stability by 
advocating for the advancement of 
infrastructure for peace, democr acy and the 
protection of human rights . In this regard as the new Chairperson  of the SADC  Organ  on 
Politics, Defense and Security  Cooperation,   I 
am calling for  peaceful General E lections in the 
Kingdom of Lesotho  on the 7th of October 2022. 
SADC is also seized wi th the developments in 
the Kingdom of Eswatini and the Republic of 
Mozambique. In that vein, I have commenced 
a process of dialoque with the leaders of 
Eswatini, Lesotho and Mozambique in order to 
ensure the succesfu l implementation of SADC 
decisions, for peace and stability to prevail in 
our region. I always say inclusivity spells harmony and 
exclusivity  spells conflict . Africa is a continent 
of 1.2 Billion citizens and the exclusion of Africa from the Security Council is an injustice. 
For as long as the Council fails to reflect in 
stature and composition, current global 
realities, it will no t be able to adequately 
address  global concerns. We therefore 
reiterate our call for the reform of the Security Council, in line with the Common African 
Position.  
Mr President, Self-determination is a human right. The 
continued injustices meted out against the 
people of Palestine are a reminder of the 
urgent need  to start implementing the two -
state solution as the only viable alternative 
that can end inequality and bring peace to both 
the peoples of Palestine, Israel and indeed the region . In the same vein, the lack of progress 
in implementing UN resolutions to resolve the 
Question of Western Sahara should be 
something we bear  collective shame for.  
Namibia pledges unwavering solidarity for 
nations that continue to bear the heavy brunt of sanctions.  Namibia reiterates its 
longstanding call for the lifting of the unjust 
embargo against Cuba. I  met a 50 year old 
Cuban man, who has not known any other way 
of life, apart  from sanctions. Please, it is time 
that the sons and daughters of Cuba are given 
their right to a dec ent life, free from from an 
embargo that denies them their right to develop their own country . Equally, we call on 
the lifting of sanctions against the Republic of 
Zimbabwe . Why are the sanctions in place for 
a country, which is making progress at all 
levels?  President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the people of Zimbabwe have made laudable 
progress and r eforms, which should be given a 
chance to succeed without the weight of sanctions.   
Mr President,  
The health of our planet is in serious jeopardy. 
Our home is on fire, w e are experiencing 
unprecedented impacts of climate change, 
including severe droughts and ravaging field 
fires. Time is a luxury we do not have . We have 
to act decisively to reduce carbon emissions as 
our contribution to the preservation of our 
planet  and people. Namibia , like many developing countries , 
remains vulnerable to the asymmetrical 
impacts of climate change.  Therefore at COP 
27, Namibia  plans to announce major 
developments in its ambitions to decarbonize  
global hard-to -abate sectors through the 
production of green hydrogen .  
Furthermore, t he first Hydrogen -to-Power 
project in Africa is expected to be operational 
by 2024 in the town of Swakopmund , Namibia .  
This is an example of what is possible when we 
pull together in the same  direction . Our ambitions are not only necessary to 
mitigate the ravagin g impacts of climate 
change , but are also a critical component of our 
post-Covid -19 economic recovery. Therefore, 
Namibia remains ready to work with the 
international community to ensure the most 
optimal utilization of its natural resources to 
combat climate change.  
A just energy transition is about fair 
opportunities  for developing nations to 
sustainably access natural endowments at 
their disposal. Namibia has recently discovered 
promising deposits of hydrocarbons and is exploring significant deposits  of rare earth 
metals. As part o f our goal to ensure 
sustainable  utilization of our natural 
resources, I recently launched the Welwitschia 
Fund, our na tion’s Sovereign Wealth F und. The 
Fund is a demonstration of  our commitment to  
fiscal prudence and sustainable resource 
management  for current and future 
generations . 
Mr President,  
In conclusion, today,  on the  21st of September 
2022, we are convening in this chamber on the 
United Nations International Day of Peace under the theme “""End racism. Build peace"" . 
Peace is a wonderful gift, but a fragile one if it 
is not handled properly. Peace is more than the 
absence of war; peace is about inclusivity and 
the development of all nations. Our United 
Nations as the premier guarantor of  
multilateralism,  is our best bet to ensure a 
peaceful and prosperous humanity.  Namibia 
will contin ue to place  a high  premium on the 
noble aspirations of  the United Nations  as a 
beacon of hope  and the equality of all nations . 
As a beneficiary of successful multilateral 
efforts, we hold in high regard the convening power of this august Assembly and recommit 
to working with fellow member states to 
change the world for the better .  
I thank you for  your kind attention!", NAM,2022

HE Mr Borut Pahor,  
President of the Republic of Slovenia   
at the  
general debate of the seventy -seventh session  
of the UN General Assembly   
 
New York, 21 September  2022  
 
 
Mr Secretary -General,  
Mr President,  
Your Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
  
I was born after the Second World War, so all my life, the cry of “Never again!” has echoed 
around the world and especially in Europe.  
  
With the exception of the war in the Balkans, even the major geopolitical changes  in 
Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall have been peaceful.  
  
This has made an important contribution to building hope for a lasting peace.  
  
This hope has been thoroughly shaken by the Russian aggression against Ukraine.  
  
Will this make us stop beli eving in the possibility of lasting peace?  
  
No. We must not leave our children a world in perpetual fear of war.  
  
For the sake of their secure future, we have a duty to do everything we can to ensure that 
the precious hope for a lasting peace returns to our hearts.  
  
After all, it was with this hope and our shared responsibility that the United Nations was 
founded.  
  
The United Nations has set very clear rules of engagement to which all Members have 
committed ourselves.  
  
These include a commitment to pea ceful settlement of disputes, cooperation and respect 
for fundamental human dignity.  
  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
I wish to speak about peace, climate change and multilateralism today.1. Peace and Security  
  
The Russian Federation’s decision for a military attack on Ukraine has shaken these rules. 
So have many other armed conflicts in different parts of the world.  
  
The Russian agression has pit international security at risk.  
  
This war is threatening the already fragile stability of the Western Ba lkans.  
  
It  has also threatened international food and energy security.  
  
I commend the UN Secretary -General for his engagement and Türkye for its support to 
reach the agreement.  
  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
  
Peace is not just an absence of war.  
  
 
In peace, leaders should strengthen and nurture good relations with other countries.  
  
It is our obligation to resolve outstanding issues in a spirit of compromise and mutual 
understanding.  
  
Only in this way, we will reduce the chances of old grievances and historical traumas 
resurfacing.  
  
I am grateful to many of you for the opportunity to do this together for the benefit and well -
being of our countries and the wider international community.  
  
Fostering good relations and building trust within societies and  between them is the most 
effective means of preventing armed conflict.  
 
. More Cooperation for a Better Future  
  
Nurturing and strengthening good relations between countries is also necessary to 
address more effectively the challenges of our times.  
  
Among these, climate change is undoubtedly one of the most pressing.  
  
Our common task is to preserve the planet for future generations.  
  
What we need is more efficient measures and more solidarity.Slovenia pledges special support to Africa, Caribbe an and Pacific to assist them in their 
efforts against biodiversity loss, water stress and climate damage.  
  
We are contributing to the “Least Developed Countries Fund” of the Global Environment 
Facility.  
  
Initiating the Green Group, Slovenia is working t ogether with like -minded countries in the 
promotion of green policies.  
  
We are deeply grateful to the General Assembly for the historic universal recognition of 
the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.  
  
 
Slovenia was one of the original  proponents, along with Costa Rica, Maldives, Morocco 
and Switzerland.  
  
That was a much -needed boost for multilateralism.  
But we can and should do more.  
  
The upcoming UN climate change, biodiversity and water conferences are an excellent 
opportunity to commit ourselves to do more and better.  
  
I wish to thank the Secretary -General for putting forward the Our Common Agenda report.  
  
We support the proposed Second World Social Summit in 2025 and expect it to address 
the challenges of structu ral inequalities.  
 
Ladies and gentlemen,  
  
There is no security and development without respect of human dignity.  
  
In all our efforts, we should be lead by rights -based approach.  
  
We should be attentive to all signs of human rights regression and should act accordingly.  
  
3. Strengthening Multilateralism and candidature for the UNSC  
  
Excellencies,  
  
The UN charter is a fundament of our international system.   
  
Rule -based order is a sine qua non for maintaining peace and security, a just and 
balan ced international system.  
  
Slovenia has proved itself a reliable and trustworthy member of the UN family and an 
honest broker.We are engaged in a genuine dialogue and constant search for creative and collaborative 
solutions to our common challenges.  
  
We are part of peacekeeping and stabilisation efforts that include humanitarian de -mining, 
rehabilitation and saving the lives of civilians all around the globe.  
  
We are actively participating in efforts to strengthen the legal framework and respect for 
international law, including ending impunity.  
  
We build trust to secure a better future.  
  
Slovenia has no enemies, but only friends all around the globe.  
  
My country is simply made to be a non -permanent me mber of the UN Security Council. 
2024–2025.  
  
Endless striving for peace, justice, mutual understanding, reconciliation – both within and 
between societies,  
respect for ethnic, national, religious diversities,  
promotion of sustainable development and solidarity.  
  
This is the task of Sloveni a, and this is our common task.  
  
Thank you.", SVN,2022

MR. PRESIDENT  OF THIS  77TH  SESSION  OF THE UN GENERAL  
ASSEMBLY,  YOUR  EXCELLENCY  CSABA  KÖRÖSI,   
SECRETARY  GENERAL  OF THE UNITED  NATIONS,  YOUR  
EXCELLENCY  ANTONIO  GUTERRES,  
EXCELLENCIES,  
DISTINGUISHED  DELEGATES,  
I am grateful  for the immense  privilege  to join Your  Excellencies  in this 
distinguished  Assembly;  a privilege  accorded  me through  a peaceful,  
democratic  transition  following  free and fair elections  in Kenya  on 9th August,  
2022.  Elections  that stand  as testimony  of the universal  power  of democracy,  
but also of the manifest  ability  of African  peoples  to invest  in stronger  nations  
and a secure  future  by directing  robust  constitutions,  effective  institutions,  
and the impartial  administr ation  of the rule of law towards  the achievement  
of shared  aspirations.  It is an honour  to be here  as the newest  Head  of State  
and Government  at this 77th  session  of the United  Nations  General  Assembly,  
exactly  six years  to the day since  I last stood  here,  when  I was Deputy  President  
of the Republic  of Kenya,   representing  my President,  on 21st  September,  
2016.  
This 77th session  comes  at a unique  moment  when  the entire  world  is 
struggling  with  multiple  grave  challenges  that include  regional  conflicts,  the 
Covid -19 pandemic,  the triple  planetary  crises,  food  insecurity  and the rising  
cost  of living.  
I take  this opportunity  to congratulate  you,  Mr. President,  on your  election  to 
preside  over  this Session,  and to express  my confidence  that your  wealth  of 
experi ence,  accumulated  over  a career  that is admirable  for both  its duration  
and distinction,  offers  us significant  assurance  of your  good  leadership.  Your 
 
 
 
motto:  ”Solutions  through  Solidarity,  Sustainability  and Science”  
succinctly  captures  with  particular  resonance  the urgent  imperatives  of our 
time.  It also calls  our attention  to the principles  and modalities  that hold  great  
promise  in unlocking  the possibilities  in the present  global  situation.  Indeed  it 
is a strong  reminder  of legitimate  expectations  throug hout  the world  of high  
performance  from  leadership.  I assure  you of Kenya’s  firm  support  and 
cooperation  during  your  tenure.  
I further  take  this opportunity  to commend  your  predecessor,  His Excellency  
Abdulla  Shahid,  for his bold  steps  in steering  the Unit ed Nations  community  
and for ensuring  its business  continuity  under  the unprecedented  
circumstances  occasioned  by multiple  global  threats  such  as the Covid -19 
pandemic.  The positive  output  of your  successful  tenure  has galvanized  the 
political  impetus  of member  states  to achieve  demonstrable  resilience  in 
pursuit  of prosperity  and sustainability  of our respective  economies.  
Excellencies,  Human  well-being  is under  grave  threat.  The health  of the planet  
requires  urgent  attention.  The immense  pressure  exerted  by conventional  
threats  such  as climate  change,  the global  food  crisis,  terrorism,  cybercrime  
and armed  conflict  has been  compounded  by unprecedented  devastating  
disruptions  due to Covid -19. I express  my approval  of the theme  for this 
session,  “A Watershed  Moment:  Transformative  Solutions  to 
Interlocking  Challenges ” because  it boldly  signals  the window  of 
opportunity  we now  have  to escalate  our engagement,  from  firm 
consensus  to decisive  action.  
In many  respects,  the Covid -19 pandemic  stripped  us of many  illusions  and 
exposed  stark  justice  and solidarity  deficits  in the face  of existential  crisis.  It 
brought  into sharp  focus  the global  economy’s  two-lane  highway,  repressively  
patrolled  by a rising  tide of exclusionist  nationalism.  A spectre  that 
 
 
 
undermines  prospects  of collective  action  and significantly  impairs  the resolve  
of the international  community  to guarantee  fundamental  rights,  including  
safety  and dignity  of the world’s  vulnerable  majority.  It is for this reason  that 
many  nations  , especially  of the Global  South,  now  advocate  for the 
democratisation  of global  governance  and a re-imagined  multilateralism  that 
is inclusive  and works  for the good  of all. Kenya  stands  ready  to work  with  
other  nations  to achieve  the pan-Africanisation  of multilateralism  and a more  
just and inclusive  system  of global  governance.  
It is important  to reflect  on these  matters  as we do our best  to get our people,  
enterprises,  and industries  back  on their  feet so that the engine  of 
development  can power  our societies  towards  pros perity  that actually  leaves  
no one behind.  Building  Back  Better  is the universal  rallying  call to 
incorporate  lessons  learnt  into doing  more,  in a better  way to recover  from  
the shock.  I suggest  that we have  a golden  opportunity  to faithfully  adhere  to 
this motto  by augmenting  it, in word  and in deed,  with  an additional  “B”: 
Building  Back  Better,  from  the Bottom.   
Building  back  better  from  the bottom  upwards  is, essentially,  about  including  
the marginalised  working  majority  in the economic  mainstream.  The bottom  
billion  relentlessly  wage  their  daily  battle  for survival   in a a crowded  arena  
characterised  by scarcity  of opportunity  and a generally  precarious  existence.  
The ingenuity,  optimism,  resilience  and energy  in this ever  bustling  bottom  is 
sometimes  called hustling . Invisible  to policy  makers  and beyond  the reach  of 
many  public  services,  these  hustlers  take  nothing  for granted,  surviving  
overwhelming  odds,  and frequently  succeeding  greatly.  A famous  American  
once  said that things  may come  to those  who wait, but only things  
left behind  by those  who hustle . It is time  to bolster  the resilience  of our 
nations;  to mainstream  these  hustlers  through  deliberate  strategies  and 
 
 
 
efforts  for economic  inclusion;  by Building  Back  Better,  from  the 
Bottom -Up.  
The interlocking  challenges  of conflicts,  triple  planetary  crises  and the global  
food  crisis  have  impeded  our momentum  and obstructed  our focus  on 
achieving  fundamental  transformations  towards  sustainable  development.  In 
the Horn  of Africa  region,  severe  droug ht, disruption  of supply  chains  in the 
region  and beyond  due to the Covid -19 pandemic,  as well as the Russia -
Ukraine  conflict  have  left us food -insecure.  Consequently,  we  have  been  
constrained  to repurpose  our strategies  to prioritise  drought  and famine  relief,  
insulating  education  from  disruption  and improving  social  protection  and 
healthcare  systems  to secure  the well-being  of our people.  
Many  countries  now  bear  witness  to the unsettling  phenomena  of rivers,  
canals  and water  reservoirs  that are drying  up on account  of droughts  and heat  
waves  occasioned  by climate  change.  Kenya  is no exception.  The northern,  arid 
and semi -arid rangelands  of our country  have  been  gravely  impacted  by 
drought  whose  severity  has not been  experienced  in 40 years.  3.1 million  
residents  of these  ASALs  are now  severely  food -insecure  on account  of scarce  
rainfall  over  three  consecutive  seasons,  leading  to poor  crop  and pasture.  This 
unprecedented  confluence  of intensely  adverse  events  has exacerbated  water  
scarcity  and starvation,  worsened  by rising  food  prices,  thus  complicating  
Kenya’s  roadmap  towards  delivering  good  quality  of life to our citizens,  and 
hindering  the progress  to achieving  SDG  6 and SDG  2. 
Severe  drought  has affected  not only  the Horn  of Africa  and the Sahel  regions , 
but continues  to devastate  many  others,  including  in Asia,  Europe  and the 
Americas.  If for no other  reason,  the fact that we are in this together  must  
strengthen  the case  for concerted  efforts  across  the continents.  With  this in 
mind,  I call on Member  States  and all relevant  stakeholders  to demonstrate 
 
 
 
strong  political  will and showcase  effective  cooperation  by supporting  the 
most  affected  countries  financially,  as well as through  sharing  land  restoration  
and climate  adaptation  technologies.  It is through  collaborations  to expand  
inclusion  that we can attain  a new  paradigm  in multilateralism.  
The latest  report  of the Intergovernmental  Panel  on Climate  Change  (IPCC)  
reminds  us that we cannot  afford  to waste  another  moment  debating  the 
merits  of doing  someth ing vis-a-vis doing  nothing.  It will soon  be too late to 
reverse  the course  of events,  and then,  even  the best  possible  interventions  
will not suffice.  As leaders,  every  day is an opportunity  to expedite  our efforts  
to confront  the triple  planetary  crisis.   
It will be recalled  that during  the Stockholm+50  meeting,  which  Kenya  had the 
honour  of co-hosting  with  Sweden,  there  was consensus  from  States  on the 
need  to act urgently  in addressing  environmental  impacts.  Given  this 
agreement,  it is deeply  concerning  that little  progress  has been  made  in 
respect  of the needful  actions.  It is time  to collectively  contemplate  urgent  
measures  needed  to implement  high -priority  actions  required  to contain  
ongoing  disruptions,  as we deliberate  on long -term  implementation  
approaches  to be undertaken.  I fully  agree  with  the Secretary -General’s  
memorable  statement,  that “we have  a rendezvous  with a climate  
disaster” . I add that we must  not be taken  by surprise.  If indeed  forewarned  
is forearmed,  this is our opportunity   to mobi lise with tremendous  
urgency  and take action  at once.  
Excellencies,  the agricultural  sector  has an important  part to play in reducing  
the severity  of climate  change.  A number  of practices  have  a bearing,  positive  
or negative,  on various  dimensions  of the environment.  Investing  in modern  
agricultural  technology  is therefore  one important  avenue  towards  tackling  
prevailing  environmental  challenges. 
 
 
 
Kenya  is responding  through  substantial  investment  in climate -resilient  
agriculture.  At the core  of our 10-year  strategy  for Agricultural  Sector  Growth  
and Transformation  are 9 flagships.  They  include  the registration  of farmers  to 
direct  incentives,  improving  farmer  practices  through  customised  extension  
services,  monitoring  of emergency  food  reserve  stocks  using  a Digital  Food  
Balance  Sheet  and the use of Early  Warning  System  to monitor  food  supplies  
and market  prices.  
Agriculture  remains  the bedrock  of the development  of many  nations,  and will 
thus  continue  to hold  the key to the creation  of equitable  and sustaina ble 
growth  for our people.  No country,  large  or small,  has ever  attained  significant  
growth  without  modernizing  its agricultural  sector.  And as we rededicate  
ourselves  to these  targets,  we must,  in the immediate  term,  find answers  to 
the severe  deficit  in the availability,  flow  and accessibility  of fertiliser  to our 
farmers  worldwide.  I couldn’t  agree  more  with  Secretary  General  Guterres  on 
his warning  right  here  yesterday,  that “without  action  now,  the global  
fertiliser  shortage  will quickly  morph  into a global  food  shortage”.   
We are encouraged  to note  that education,  health,  agriculture  and numerous  
other  public  services  have  become  increasingly  reliant  on digital  access.  The 
world  needs  greater  investment  in the development  of ICT infrastructure,  
accompa nied  with  policies  that support  innovation  and increased  acquisition  
and deployment  of technology.  In so doing,  we should  be driven  by the 
conviction  that these  measures  offer  a viable  shortcut  to poverty  reduction  
and the promotion  of inclusive  developmen t. I call for stronger  global  
partnerships  to enhance  ICT infrastructure  in developing  countries  and bridge  
the yawning  digital  divide  between  the global  south  and the rest of the world.  
Excellencies,  this 77th United  Nations  General  Assembly  follows  the 
commemoration  of the 50th anniversary  of the United  Nations  Environmental 
 
 
 
Programme  - UNEP@50  as well as Stockholm+50  and the 4th United  
Nations  Ocean  Conference  in Lisbon.  Outcomes  of these  conferences  
demanded  real commitment  to address  global  environment al concerns  as a 
matter  of urgency,  and for a just transition  to sustainable  economies  that work  
for all people.  
The March  2022  landmark  resolution  of the 5th United  Nations  
Environmental  Assembly  in Nairobi  to end plastic  pollution  is a decisive  
signal  that the world  is prepared  and motivated  to act on this menace.  Kenya  
is committed  to work  closely  with  other  nations  to pursue  legally  binding  
instruments  aimed  at bringing  an end to plastic  pollution.  As the host  nation  
to UNEP  and the UN-HABITAT , Kenya  affirms  that these  critical  United  
Nations  Agencies  have  an indispensable  role in the promotion  of 
environmental  sustainability  globally,  as well as in developing  socially  and 
environmentally  sound  and  sustainable  cities.   
In keeping  with  its strong  commitm ent to multilateral  institutions,  Kenya  has 
made  available  more  land  for the United  Nations  Office  in Nairobi  (UNON)  to 
facilitate  the upgrading  of its complex.  I take  this opportunity  to call on 
Member  States  to complement  this contribution  through  enhanc ed financing  
to adequately  modernise  the UNON  facilities.  
Kenya  remains  a strong  advocate  for making  the sustainable  use of Ocean  
and Blue  Economy  resources  a development  priority,  holding  the firm 
belief  that significantly  increased  investment  in this essential  sector  can end 
hunger,  reduce  poverty,  create  jobs and spur  economic  growth.  I urge  the 
Secretary -General  to continue  calling  attention  to the urgent  need  to develop  
this vital  sector.  In particular,  I further  urge  the Secretary -General  to call on 
developed  countries  to invest  in sustainable  fishing,  protect  marine 
 
 
 
ecosystems  and to share  ocean -based  climate  solutions  with  developing  
countries.  
For our part,  I am pleased  to report  that,  building  on the historic  2018  
Sustainable  Blue  Economy  Conferenc e in Nairobi,  Kenya  is reviewing  
its National  Blue  Economy  Strategy  to strengthen  community  structures  
in participatory  management  of freshwater,  coastal  and marine  resources  and 
ecosystems.  The strategy  is expected  to contribute  to our economic  
developmen t through  food  and nutrition  security,  coastal  and rural  
development  and income  increases  along  the aquaculture  value  chains,  
maritime  transport  and tourism.  We invite  development  partnerships  to invest  
in Africa  towards  building  capacity  to sustainably  utilise marine  resources.  We 
must  rally  together  to make  the best  use of Africa’s  vast blue  resources  in 
developing  our economies  while  meeting  our climate  targets.  
As we look  forward  to the 27th Conference  of Parties  to the United  
Nations  Framework  Convention  on Climate  Change  - COP27 , 
scheduled  for Sharma -El-Sheikh  in Egypt,  it is logical  to expect  that Member  
States  will shift  their  attention  towards  the development  and implementation  
of frameworks  for climate  change  mitigation.  Accomplishment  of pending  
actions  by Member  States  is essential  for the implementation  work  that lies 
ahead.   I therefore  call upon  all of us to urgently  deliver  on all commitments  
made  towards  climate  financing.  On this matter,  it is critical  to emphasize  that 
we are runnin g out of time.  
Over  the past  decade,  Kenya  has sustained  its aggressive  pursuit  of rapid  
socioeconomic  transformation  through  three  principal  roadmaps.  First  is the 
Kenya  National  Vision  2030 , the formal  long -term  blueprint  aimed  at 
transforming  Kenya  into a newly -industrialising,  upper -middle -income  country  
providing  high  quality  of life to all its citizen  in a clean  and secure  environment 
 
 
 
by 2030.  The second  has been  the African  Union’s  Agenda  2063  and the 
third,  the Sustainable  Development  Goals . Kenya  looks  towards  tapping  
into a variety  of resources  to catalyse  the achievement  of these  interlocking  
and mutually  reinforcing  objectives.  
The disruption  and ensuing  crisis  due to Covid -19 pandemic  compelled  us to 
diversify  our focus  into new  interventions,  including  an Economic  Stimulus  
Programme , a Covid -19 Economic  Recovery  Strateg y and a Covid -
19 Social  Economic  re-engineering  Recovery  Strategy , all aimed  at 
mitigating  the adverse  impacts  of the pandemic.  I confirm  that we have  done  
the best  of everything  we could  in the circumstances.  Nevertheless,  it is not 
enough.  Kenya  and the rest of Africa,  like other  developing  countries,  are in 
need  of greater  international  partnership  and cooperation  to avert  economic  
crisis  in the wake  of the pandemic.  
Developing  countries,  being  heavily  burdened  by external  debt  servicing,  run 
the risk of losing  development  gains  due to the shocks  inflicted  by the 
pandemic  and associated  disruptions.  I call upon  global  financial  institutions  
and the international  community  to take  urgent  measures  and release  all 
existing  financial  instruments  to provide  much -needed  additional  liquidity  and 
secure  better  fiscal  space  for developing  countries  like Kenya  to enhance  social  
investment,  support  climate  change  adaptation  and mitigation,  address  
security  needs  and resolve  development  financing  challenges.  
On behalf  of Kenya,  therefore,  I join other  leaders  in calling  upon  the World  
Bank , the International  Monetary  Fund  and other  multilateral  lenders  to 
extend  pandemic -related  debt  relief  to the worst  hit countries,  especially  
those  affected  by the devastating  combination  of conflict,  climate  change  and 
covid -19. Furthermore,  I urge  the G20  to extend  and expand  the scope  of the 
 
 
 
common  framework  to suspend  or reschedule  debt  repayments  by midd le-
income  countries  during  the pandemic  recovery  period.  
At this point,  I would  like this distinguished  assembly  to take  a moment  and 
consider  the peace  and security  landscape.  A landscape  currently  beset  with  
multiple  challenges,  yet abounding  with  consid erable  opportunities.  Our 
home  region  of Eastern  and Horn  of Africa  is, in particular,  burdened  by 
significant  conflicts  and changes  with  implications  for the region’s  
development.  We stand  on the cusp  of vast opportunity  for galvanising  
confidence  buildin g measures  to generate  and sustain  momentum  towards  
sustainable  peace.  
In its role as an anchor  state  in the region,  Kenya  has sustained  our investment  
in diplomatic  efforts  to find lasting  peace  in myriad  situations  within  and 
beyond  the region.  Although  some  processes  have  yielded  undeniable  
successes,  challenges  remain.  I therefore  strongly  reiterate  our call for 
partnership  towards  confidence -building  measures  and urge  more  concerted  
efforts  towards  sustainable  peace  and stability.  
Kenya  is currently  serving  in the United  Nations  Security  Council.  I am proud  
to confirm  that our engagement  over  the last 2 years  has prioritised  Regional  
Peace  and Security,  Countering  Terrorism  and Violent  Extremism,  
Peace  Support  Operations,  Climate  and Security  as critica l 
contributions  to collective  efforts  to build  a safer,  more  prosperous  and 
peaceful  world.  I am also proud  to state  that Kenya  has continued  to champion  
closer  cooperation  between  regional  mechanisms  and the Security  Council  as 
an effective  means  of achie ving international  peace  and security.  
Kenya  continues  to advocate  the renewal  of the African  Union  security  
architecture  which  draws  comparative  strength  from  the highly  productive 
 
 
 
complementarity  between  the United  Nations,  the African  Union  and the 
Regi onal Economic  Communities . Working  closely  with  the two elected  
African  Countries  of the A3 in the UN Security  Council,  we are committed  to 
finding  a stronger  African  voice  in the Council,  and achieving  a consensus -
driven,  rule-based  multilateral  system.  It is our manifest  intention  to see 
greater  Pan-Africanization  of the global  agenda  in order  to make  
multilateralism  work  for the people  of the world  in their  diversity.  It is time  for 
multilateralism  to reflect  the voice  of the farmers,  represent  the hopes  of 
villagers,  champion  the aspirations  of pastoralists,  defend  the rights  of 
fisherfolk,  express  the dreams  of traders,  respect  the wishes  of workers  and,  
indeed,   protect  the welfare  of all peoples  of the Global  South.  
Let me express  the strong  collectiv e conviction  of my country  that the 
relevance,  legitimacy  and moral  authority  of the United  Nations  will forever  
remain  deficient,  undermined  by the absence  of comprehensive  reforms  of 
the United  Nations  Security  Council . We therefore  remain  firmly  
committ ed to reforming  the Security  Council  to make  it a more  effective,  
representative  and democratic  global  institution.  Given  the magnitude  and 
variety  of challenges  the world  continues  to confront,  a more  fit-for-purpose  
United  Nations  is urgently  needed,  that possesses  the legitimacy  and efficacy  
in dealing  with  threats  to international  peace  and security.  A just and inclusive  
world  order  cannot  be spearheaded  by a United  Nations  Security  Council  
that persistently  and unjustly  fails the inclusivity  criterion.  Similarly,  threats  to 
democracy  will not be credibly  resolved  by an undemocratic  and 
unrepresentative  Security  Council . It is vitally  important  for this critical  
institution  to reflect  the values  it is entrusted  to protect,  defend  and uphold  
on behalf  of humankind. 
 
 
 
There  might  never  be a more  opportune  time to revisit  the practice  of unilateral  coercive  
actions,  which  often  violate  fundamental  tenets  of a rule-based  international  order,  such  as 
those  imposed  on Zimbabwe  and Cuba.  Apart  from undermining  the sovereign  equality  of 
nations,  they also indiscriminately  punish  the general  citizenry,  reserving  their bitterest  sting  
for innocent  hustlers  and the vulnerable.  This compounds  injustice  and worsens  suffering.  
The Covid -19 pandemic  severely  disrupted  health systems,  seriously  
challenging  the implementation  of programmes  that are vital  for the 
realisation  of health -related  Sustainable  Development  Goals . To place  us 
firmly  back  on track,  and accelerate  our progress  towards  these  SDG  targets,  
it is imperati ve for us to foster  sustainable  partnerships  between  
Governments,  other  state  actors,  the civil society  and the private  sector.  This 
modality  of collective  action  is particularly  vital  for building  resilient  health  
systems,  whose  importance  in enabling  us withstand  future  pandemics  and 
other  health  crises  can no longer  be disputed.  
For this reason,  Kenya  will continue  to strongly  support  the development  of a 
legally  binding  World  Health  Organisation  international  instrument  to 
anchor  global  solidarity  and promote  equity.  The fact of the matter  is that the 
Covid -19 pandemic  exposed,  for all the world  to see, the severe  deficit  of these  
critical  values  in our present  multilateral  configuration.  Global  supply  chains  
remained  impervious  to demand  in the Global  South  generally,  and Africa  in 
particular.  Unequal  access  to vaccines  underscored  this unjust  and unequal  
situation  with  unforgettable  clarity.  Whenever  human  life, security  and 
welfare  is in jeopardy,  it is immoral  to administer  interventions  through  
frame works  that are anchored  on fundamental  inequality.   
We are all witnesses  to admirable  demonstrations  of effective  solidarity  in 
response  to crises  in various  parts  of the world.  Our knowledge  of the 
possibility  of spontaneous  yet resolute  global  solidarity  reinforces  the African  
exception  as particularly  repugnant.  From  genocides  and civil conflict  to 
 
 
 
famine  and pandemics,  the African  continent  is consistently  left behind  to bear  
the brunt  of weak  solidarity  and disastrous  failure  of multilateralism.  Histor y 
indicates  the last time  that Africa  was the focal  point  of strong  and effective  
multilateral  consensus  was during  the Berlin  Conferences  of 1884 -1885,  and 
the character  of the ensuing  interventions  casts  a long  shadow  to date.   
Not to put too fine a point  to it, the failure  of multilateralism  during  crises  
which  relegate  the people  of Africa  outside  the circle  of moral  consideration,  
and normalises  humanitarian  neglect  and other  casual  injustices  are failures  
of humanity.  Nothing  about  Africa  or its peoples  makes  it acceptable  for this 
type  of failure  to persist  in this era, and we have  an urgent  moral  duty  to do 
better.  And to right  this wrong.  
For two decades,  Africa  has borne  the brunt  of three  epidemics:  the human  
immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV),  tube rculosis  (TB)  and malaria.  I applaud   
innovative  partnerships  like the Global  Fund   for their  progress  in addressing  
the three  menaces,  and also welcome  the ambitious  targets  set for the 7th 
replenishment  cycle.  Kenya  is committed  to supporting  the Global  Fund  and 
implementing  the agreed  targets  in order  to actualise  our pledge  at the 
replenishment  conference.   
Kenya  calls  upon  all countries  implementing  the Global  Fund  programs,  
especially  fellow  African  states,  to remain  at the forefront  in championing  for 
successful  replenishment  of the fund.  This  way,  the mobilisation  of much -
needed  resources  is enhanced,  bringing  us closer  to the final  elimination  of 
these  dangerous  diseases.  
In conclusion,  Kenya  joins  the Secretary  General  in calling  for the 
strengthe ning  of multilateralism  as the only  sustainable  path  to a peaceful,  
stable  and prosperous  world  for all. This is the imperative  of our time,  and the 
 
 
 
call of this moment.  It is time  to work  on the trust  deficit  with  stronger  
conviction  that none  of us is really safe until  all of us are safe.   
The theme  of the 77th Session,  “A Watershed  moment:  Transformative  
Solutions  to Interlocking  Challenges ” demands  of us that we recognise  
that the crises  we must  confront  are  inter -linked  in complicated  ways.  They  
can only  be effectively  addressed  through  more  imaginative  strategies  and 
innovative  formulae.  A population  of 8 billion  people,  in a densely  networked  
world  increasingly  looks  up to the multilateral  system   as the anchor  for their  
individual  aspirations  directly,  and indirectly  through  robust  national  
frameworks.  Increasingly,  therefore,  the United  Nations  system  is expected  to 
be responsive  to these needs,  and for the proceedings  in forums  like this,  to 
speak  to ordinary  people  in far flung  reaches  of our incredibly  diverse  globe.  It 
is impossible  to address  all their  individual  needs  directly,  but it is possible  to 
respond  to all of them  by speak ing with  conviction  to the universal  values  of 
equality,  inclusion,  justice,  solidarity  and collective  action,  and by making  sure  
that all our interventions  effectively  reflect  them  with  clarity.   
The integrity  of the international  order  must  be measured  by the distance  
separating  our resolutions,  consensus  and agreement  from  decisive  actions,  
committed  interventions  and effective  solutions.  A watershed  moment,  
therefore,  demands  that we reduce  that gap drastically,  and quickly.   
Kenya  pursues  numerous  esse ntial  domestic  agenda  through  the multilateral  
framework.  We are heavily  invested  in the strength,  effectiveness  and 
eventual  success  of all interventions  formulated  by this institution.  It is 
important  that the outputs  of this and other  similar  fora achie ve immediate  
resonance  in the minds  and lives  of our youth  still seeking  opportunity  to 
express  and actualise  themselves,  our farmers  working  to feed  the nation,  our 
jua kali entrepreneurs  striving  in pursuit  of success  in the informal  economy, 
 
 
 
and our professionals  who  formulate  policy,  implement  strategy  and monitor  
service  delivery  in the public  and private  sectors.  
Africa  places  immense  value  in the international  community  and the 
tremendous  possibilities  it can unlock,  through  inclusive,  sustainable  and 
effective  action,  to transform  the lives  of our peoples  and establish  lasting  
peace,  security  and shared  prosperity.  This watershed  moment  is our chance  
to turn  the key and open  this door  of opportunity.  We can make  progress  in 
addressing  the triple  glob al threats,  and liberate  ourselves  from  the shame  of 
past  failures  of multilateralism.  At this watershed  moment,  we must  not only  
choose,  but also act decisively  to bequeath  to our children  and their  children  
a greener,  safer,  healthier  and more  abundant  Earth.  Let us do it.

Statement by His Excellency Dr Mohamed Irfaan Ali,  
President of the Co -operative Republic of Guyana  at the 
General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations 
General Assembly  
UN Headquarters in New York, 21st September 2022  
 
Mr. President,  
• I extend my heartfelt congratulations on your election as President of the 
77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am confident that 
your stewardship will lend further credence to the impactful role of 
multilateralism in reso lving global challenges.  
 
• I thank your predecessor Mr. Abdulla Sha hid for his shrewd leadership over 
the past year. I had the distinct privilege of welcoming him recently to 
Guyana and benefitting from his experience in championing an inclusive 
future for  our youth.  
 
• Congratulations to  him, the Secretary General  and the General Assembly 
for the recently passed resolution on the establishment of a United Nations 
Youth Office . One month ago, i n Guyana, I launched the  Youth Advisory 
Council as part of my government’s commitment to  ensur e the involvement 
of young people in decision -making  and development as government works 
to build Guyana’s future .  
• We are living in a troubled World which has lost its balance.  
 
• Indeed, our collective  actions , as leaders  today , will convey to the next 
generation that their aspirations, their future,  and that of the planet are worth 
fighting for.  
 
• The international community is facing  a series of interlocking challenges - 
o a global pandemic,  
o climate challenges , 
o energy and food crises and  
o inter-State conflicts.  
 
• A consequence of the pandemic, approximately 97 million more persons 
are living on less than  $1.90 per day, significantly increasing the global 
poverty rate  and inequalities .  
 
• The developing world lost revenues and income that were earmarked for 
the achievement of many Sustainable Development Goals , pushing us 
further away from our 2030 targets .   
 
• A UN Report in March  2022 spoke definitively to the unequal distribution of 
covid 19 vaccines and its impact on widening the economic impact between 
the rich and poor. The study found that low -income countries could have 
increased their GDP by US$16.7 billion in 2021 if they had a similar 
vaccination rate as high -income developed countries.  
 
• HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS INEQUALITY? • HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS INJUSTICE?  
• Guyana’s position is that there MUST be an immediate re -examination of  
the financing gap and the debt portfolio of the developing countries  to open 
fiscal space and create an opportunity for - 
o recovery,  
o bridging the gap and  
o attaining the SDG goals.  
 
• Guyana welcomes the global initiatives around pandemic preparedness. It 
is imperative that we collectivel y discuss how to address  any potential  
pandemics and health threats  so that we are better equipped in the futu re 
to avoid the  inequalities that exist.  
 
Food Security  
Mr. President, Excellencies  
• The global food security problem has disproportionately affected us.  
 
• The prevalence of moderate and severe food insecurity trended upwards 
since 2014, with the estimated increase in 2020 equall ing that of the previous 
5 years combined.  In 2020, 2. 37 Billion of the world’s population were food 
insecure.   
 
• Additionally, the World Food Program and FAO warned that acute food 
insecurity would worsen in 20 hunger hotspots in June – Sept 2022.  
 
• Since the start of th e pandemic , global food prices  have  surged by 65% 
and are expected to remain high in the medium te rm, as a result of  – 
• Supply chain constraints • A hike in energy costs,  
• Higher shipping costs ,  
• Climate issues  and 
• The war in Ukraine . 
 
• Further, since the onset of the Russia -Ukraine war, global food prices 
increased sharply reaching an all -time high in February 2022. The FAO 
projects that the production of cereals – a crop relied on the most in the 
world, would decline by 40 million tonnes or 1.4% when compared to the 
preceding year.  
 
• The global  food import bill’s  trajectory is a whopping US$1.8 trillion  
this year – a new record (FAO) . 
• The global food import bill  is projected to rise by US$51 billion from 
2021 – $49 billion  of which reflects higher prices (FAO) . 
 
• The question is WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT THIS?  
 
• Can the  reversal of  export ban s on rice  and wheat and freeing up of 
grains , help this situation?   
 
• The answer is a resounding YES .  For example,  export bans  of rice from 
India  and wheat from Russia contributed to a price increase of 12.3 % and 
9% for rice and wheat respectively.  
 
• AS WORLD LEADERS, WE MUST FIND THE BALANCE  NOW . • In honouring our commitment to  promote peace, stability , respect for 
territorial  integrity and democracy , and the human rights  of all , we must 
work collectively to prevent situations that  can widen inequality and 
create social and economic havoc .  
 
• NOW IS THE TIME for us to decide  if a new approach  is needed  to 
guarantee  food security, access to health care  and quality education, 
and security  from conflict  and wars.  
 
According to World Bank and Global Trade, between January – June 2022 , 
135 policy measures  were announced or implemented that affected trade in 
food and fertiliser. During the same period 34 nations imposed restrictive 
export measures on food and fertilisers.  
 
The question s, therefore , are –  
• whether globalisation is only applicable under normal conditions?  Or  
• whether it is opportunistic in its applicatio n and when a crisis arises , 
we lock ourselves in and forget about multilateralism and 
globalisation ? 
 
The evidence is glaring :  covid -19 vaccination and now access to food and 
fertiliser .  
 
• A welcomed initiative is the FAO’s Global Food Import Financing 
Facility (FIFF) which seeks to respond to the prevailing soaring food import 
costs and addressing the needs of the most exposed . 
 
• However, there is need to revise the eligibility criteria to  accommodate 
countries bey ond the categories of low -income and lower -middle income groups . This narrow grouping heightens the chance that many at -risk, 
economically vulnerable countries , such as  the Caribbean with large food 
and food import needs, will be excluded.  
 
Climate Change  
Mr President, Excellencies  
 
• We all recognise that there is climate c risis. We must go back to some of 
the decisions . For example,  at COP26 We agreed - no more coal -fired 
power  projects – what is the reality?  
 
• While policies and planning for climate change adaptation are expanding, 
according to The Adaptation Gap Report 2021:  The Gathering Storm, 
financing and implementation are still far behind where they should be.  
 
• This analysis  shows  the costs of adaptation are most likely to be higher tha n 
the predicted range of USD 140 –300 billion annually by 2030 and USD 280 –
500 billion annually by 2050 for developing nations. In 2019, USD 79.6 billion 
was allocated to developing nations for planning and carrying out mitigation 
and adaptation measures. T he gap between predicted adaptation costs and 
existing public adaptation finance flows is generally growing and ranges from 
five to ten times . 
 
• The paltry $100 billion pledge (and the failure to meet it) must be viewed in 
the context of the likely costs of  climate action for mitigation, adaptation and 
addressing loss and damage.  It is not enough!  
 
• The adoption  of broad rules on carbon markets  in Glasgow , has the potential 
to unlock critical resources for forest -rich countries . • Forested countries, like Guyana , can potentially earn billions  of dollars 
accessible through the Voluntary Carbon Markets.    
• However, the current approximate  price is US10.00 per tonne on the 
voluntary market  - Whilst according to an IMF Report, the price should 
be closer to US$70.00 per dollar per tonne.  
 
• COP 27 must make progress in refining the rules for the implementation of 
Article 6 of the Paris Agreement  and make decisions that would increase the 
price of carbon traded in voluntary carbon markets . 
 
Energy Security   
The world is also faced with an energy crisis - 
• In 2019 , almost 10% of the world’s population did not have access to 
electricity.   
 
• Electricity generated  by fossil fuel increased by 178% between 2000 and 
2021 . 
 
• Electricity generated   from coal increased by 173% for the corresponding 
period (between 2000 and 2021).  
 
• Based on a recent Energy Outlook from the US Energy  Information 
Administration (EIA), coal -fired generation is expected to be a key energy 
component as a result of several factors including – 
o a drop in the share of natural gas and  
o rising oil prices. • Whilst all of this is occurring , the  global  energy demand  is projected to 
increase by 47% in the next thirty  (30) years.  According to the IEA, global 
elect ricity demand grew  by 6 percent in 202 1 and is projected to grow by 
2.4% in 2022 , of which only 50 percent is expected to be met from 
renewables. As such, the other 50 percent would have to be met from 
nonrenewable energy sources.    
  
• Furthermore, analysis by the IEA indica tes that getting on the path to net -
zero emissions by 2050 would require a three -fold increase in the current 
level of investments in the clean energy transition, to about US$4 trillion by 
2030.  
 
• The question is , therefore , how do we realistically strike this balance?  
 
• This conversation must be practical , comprehensive and fact base d. We all 
recognise that adjustments must be made to save our planet . But how will 
we craft this adjustment , considering  the energy  and food cris es which are  
also critical  and ensur e that inequality and access do not widen.  
 
• In this energy transition, fossil fuel remains  necessary. In this context , we 
are convinced that new entrants like Guyana must be part of th is balance d 
approach.  Even as a new entrant, Guyana proposed , at COP2 6, the 
removal  of subsidies from fossil fuel production and advocated the need for 
a strong global carbon price.  
 
• We however do not believe that new entrants should be punished by 
removing access to financing  and increasing costs of financing. This in 
effect will o protect an existing monopoly,  
o drive up the costs of investments and  
o deliver a higher priced product.  
 
What is Guyana doing to bridge the gaps of inequalities?   
Mr President, Excellencies  
We are committed to building a Guyana that a ddresses issues of food 
secu rity, climate change , energy security and inequalities within our country 
and the region . 
 
Under the banner of ONE GUYANA, my government has embarked on many 
initiatives to help bridge the gaps of inequality and access.  
 
Food Security  
• We are on a path to  reduce Guyana’s f ood import bill  and increase food 
security - through  cultivation and  investment s in new te chnology and smart 
agriculture  to position Guyana as  a leading food prod ucer in Caricom , 
providing incentives , capital , land and opportunities  for youth and women to 
participate in the agriculture transformation.  
 
• To this end, we have earmarked 35% of all new agro business  to be led by 
women  and have increase d youth participation in agriculture with the use of 
technology by more than 40%.  
 
Climate change:  
We are pursuing  a Low Carbon  Development  Strat egy which aims at creating 
a model for – • Value Ecosystem Services and sustainably developing and managing 
the blue economy  
• Invest ment  in Clean Energy and Stimulate Low Carbon Growth  
• Protect ing Against Climate Change and Biodiversity Loss  
• Align ment  with Global Climate and Biodiversity Goals . 
 
• Our forests , which is the size of England , store 19.5 gigatonnes  of carbon 
with a deforest ation rate of less than 0.05%    
• We intend to continue  the sustainable management of our forest as a key 
national and global good.  
 
Energy Security:  
• Having already achieved net zero, we are working steadfast ly in our  
transition from a 2020 status of 95% dependence on H eavy Fuel Oil (HFO)  
and Diesel to an energy mix which includes  - 
o hydropower, solar, wind and natural gas, from which more than 
500MW of new generating capacity  will come on stream ;  
o of which 87% of th is generated energy will be from clean and 
renewable sources . 
Education  
• Human resource transformation through education is a key driver of our 
development. The achievement of inclusive and equitable quality education 
and promotion of lifelong learning opportunities for all is inextricably linked to 
attaining other sustainable development goals, including full empl oyment, 
poverty eradication and gender equality. • Access to free quality primary and secondary education  will soon be followed 
by free tertiary education.   
 
• The Government of Guyana has  
o invested in our Indigenous Communities in infrastructure, education, 
training, health care and installing internet access capabilities ; and  
o commenced the training our workforce for 2030 and beyond . 
 
• Soon we will be offering coding skills at our primary and secondary levels.  
 
Gender equality  
• Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in all spheres of 
life is a national priority for Guyana.  
 
• We are committed to  ensur ing equal access to education for girls  and boys . 
Indeed , more girls are attending school in Guyana and graduating from 
university.  Our focus  now includes ensuring that our boys are not left behind.   
 
• We have initiated several programmes to create earning and employment 
opportunities for women and promote their financial independence , 
recogniz ing that empowe rment , is inextricably linked to addressing the root 
causes of and eradicating discrimination and gender -based violence.  
 
To achieve balanced  growth  and sustainable and resilient  development for 
Guyana , our strategies must focus  on  
• developing a diversified  economic  base,  
• strengthen our agri cultural  systems , • human resource transformation , 
• investing in the social sector to deliver wor ld class health, educ ation 
and housing for all our people,  
• ensuring an inclusive and equitable  socie ty in which prosperity is 
enjoyed by all ,  
• Building  our future, through  the strengthening  of our demo cratic  values  
and respect for the rule of law . 
 
Rules based international Order  
Mr President, Excellencies  
As part of the global family Guyana   
• Subscribes to  a rules -based international order as well as the need for a 
resurgence of political will and commitment to protect the multilateral 
architecture.   
 
• We are deep ly concern ed about the number of p ersons  living in conflict 
situations.  
 
• The ongoing war in Ukraine is having terrible effects on the region  and 
country,  the impacts of which are disproportionate ly felt by women and 
children .  
• We urge a speedy and peaceful resolution of the conflict and e xpress  
support for the efforts of the United Nations ’ Secretary -General in this 
regard. • In our own region, we again join the overwhelming majority of members 
of the international community in  reiterat ing Guyana’s  rejection of the 
sanctions imposed on the Republic of Cuba.    
 
• Guyana also restates its solidarity with the Palestinian people and its 
support for their dignified existence in their own homeland in accordance 
with a two -state solution.  
 
• Guyana does not condone or support the threat of , or use of force in 
relations be tween states or in the resolution of disputes. Consistent with 
the Charter of the United Nations, Guyana subscribes to the use of 
peaceful means to settle disputes.  
 
• In this context , Guyana thanks those who have already expressed support 
for our candidature for non -permanent membership of the UN Security 
Council.  
 
• In the matter of Guyana’s sovereignty and territorial integrity - challenged 
and threatened by Venezuela as it is, we remain – to quote  the Secretary 
General at the opening of the  Gener al Debate yesterday –  “committed to 
make the most of every diplomatic tool for the pacific settlement of 
disputes, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations ”.  
 
• In this case, ‘judicial settlement’ as determined by the Secretary General 
himself. • The world’s nations can be assured that Guyana shall remain true to those 
peaceful processes and deny every effort to depart from them. The 
International Court of Justice has already affirmed its jurisdiction in the 
matter.  
 
Mr President, Excellencies  
• This Assembly must reinvigorate the spirit of multilateralism in finding 
solutions to the extant challenges which bedevil the global community of 
States.  
 
• I close by reminding us  all of an old quote “A hungry man is an angry 
man” .  
 
• Global inequality is linked to global security and global security is linked 
to the prosperity  of all humanity . 
 
I thank you.", GUY,2022

77th UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY “It has perhaps always been the case that the waging of peace is the hardest form of 
leadership of all. I know of no single formula for success, but over the years I have observed that some attributes of leadership are universal, and are often about findin g ways of 
encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration, to work together.”  
A quote from the speech of her Majesty, the l ate Elizabeth II from 2010, delivered here, 
at the United Nations General Assembly . 
 Today, on the International Day of Peace, I stand  here to urge the world leaders to be 
faithful to the legacy of Elizabeth II , so that we can live in peace.  
 Dear Secretary -General António Guterres , Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen!  
I am particularly pleased and honoured to  greet  my fellow Hungarian, President Csaba 
Kőrösi . With hi s presidency, after forty years, Hungary is  again serv ing as President of the 
UN General Assembly for one year . It is a great honour for Hungary  – and especially so in 
the present challenging situation .  Mr President, dear Csaba I wish you every success in 
your work.  
I am standing in front of you today as the Pr esident of Hungary . The first woman president 
of my country, wife and  mother of three children.  
As a President and as a mother  I feel responsible for preserving an environment for the 
generations to come, in which they can enjoy  secur ity and comfort .  
Today, on the International Day of Peace, I  stand in front of th e General Assembly to 
reaffirm our commitment to the UN Charter , Article I : 
“To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective 
measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement 
of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace;”  
Let us remind ourselves  to the main aim why the United Nations was brought to life.  Peace. We, people and leaders in the Western world, often pretend  that we have lived in an age 
of permanent peace and prosperity since the end of the Second World War. In many ways 
this m ight  be true, indeed , we live in a more peaceful and prosperous age than before.  
Let’s not forget , though,  the wars and armed conflicts that rage in many regions of the 
globe, which kill innocent people, tear  families  apart, destroy infrastructure and 
economies, turn well -kept agricultures into wasteland and add to the destruction of the 
world that surrounds us.  
According to the Council on Foreign Relations’s Global Conflict Tracker, there are currently 27 ongoing conflicts worldwide. The tracker categorizes conflict into thr ee 
groups: “worsening,” “unchanging,” and “improving.” Right now, there’s not a single conflict described as “improving.”  
Globally, conflict and violence are on the rise, according to the United Nations. The UN has 
warned that peace is more under threat around the world than it has been since World 
War II.  
The number of wars and armed conflicts around the world has been rising intensively 
since the Second World War. The scholarly optimism that the decline in the number of casualties might lead to a proces s where armed conflicts become irrelevant was quickly 
overshadowed by recent developments in Europe and other parts of the world.  
Excellencies,  
I come from Hungary, from the heart of Europe. Everyone would assume that since the 
Second World War , peace has been a regional characteristic.   
Let us  not forge t that only eleven years after the end of  Second World War , Soviet tanks 
were rolling on the streets of Budapest. We had  forty- five years of communist dictatorship  
and it didn’t take long after the peaceful change of regime of 1989 that war broke out  in 
our imminent S outhern neighbourhood.  The killing lasted for a decade. 
Now, after hardly more than 20 years, war is raging on the European continent – once 
again in Hungary’s neighbouring country.  It fills us with particular concern, especially 
because ethnic Hungarians living across the borders  also shed their blood . Russia’ s war against Ukraine is a constant threat and security risk not only for the 
Ukrainian citizens living in the war zone, but also for all of us . The threat of escalation is a 
reason for  worry and action.  
Hungary firmly condemn s Russia's aggression against Ukraine, which has destroyed 
peace in Europe, caused dramatic  human suffering and destruction, and has serious 
repercussions on the world order.  
Since the beginning of this conflict, Hungarians  have stood with the victims. We h ave been 
providing economic, social and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and to the Ukrainian people 
fleeing the war. Hungary is currently implementing the largest humanitarian operation in her recent history.  The Hungarian people, churches, civil organizations , local authorities 
and the government gave shelter to nearly one million refugees since the outbreak of the 
conflict.  
We have learnt that war is evil  and leads nowhere. A war only has victims, and the ones 
with the greatest losses are families: mothers and fathers who lose their children in the battlefield, wives who lose their husbands in the fighting, children who lose their brothers, 
sisters in the hell of war.  
It is in the strongest possible terms that we call for the investigation of war crimes committed against innocent civilians. These crimes must be documented, investigated and prosecuted by the relevant international institutions . No crimes com mitted can go 
unpunished.  
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
What do we want in the UN? To win  the war ?  
We should not stand for winning any war.  We need to  stand for restor ing peace.  If there 
is a will, there is a way.  
Hungary is a member of several allied  systems. Above all, the United Nations, NATO, the 
European Union, the Council of Europe, and I could go on. These organisations were created by their founding fathers to pursue peace as their 
fundamental goal. I could say that they were created by the desire for peace, and I am convinced that the service of peace is the foundation of their identity.  
Let me recall again the words of late queen Elizabeth II . I quote : “The aims and values which 
inspired the United Nations Charter endure: to promote international peace, security and justice; to relieve and remove the blight of hunger, poverty and disease; and to protect the 
rights and liberties of every citizen”.  
Hungary urges  fellow member states to declare peace as the maj or priority in the present 
conflict between Russia and Ukraine.  
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
It is by no means self -evident, that today, at the time of war, energy and food crises , the 
organisations set up to avoid war and preserve peace are focusing on ideological 
indoctrination.  
This is not what is needed today. Instead, we must regain our ability to distinguish 
between the essential and the irrelevant, the important and the unimportant, real ity and 
fiction .  
Most of us came to the Assembly from London. We attended Elizabeth II's funeral together and bowed at her coffin. We b ade farewell to an exceptional monarch whose life was 
steeped in service to peace. We owe it to the people and to her memory to make our 
decisions in the same sp irit. 
Let me conclude by quoting Winston Churchill  from 1953 : 
“Those who can win a war well can rarely make a good peace, and those who could make a 
good peace would never have won the war. ” 
 
Let us make a good peace.", HUN,2022

STATEMENT  
BY  
HIS EXCELLENCY DR. JULIUS MAADA BIO  
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE,  
 
AT THE 77TH SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS  GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY  
 
“GENERAL DEBATE ”  
 
NEW YORK, 21ST SEPTEMBER 2022 
 Excellency, Csaba Kőrösi , President of the General Assembly ; 
Excellency, António Guterres, Secretary -General of the United Nations ; 
Excellencies, Heads of State and Government , 
Distinguished Delegates , 
 
1. Let me commend the President of the 7 6th session  of the General Assembly , 
H.E. Mr. Abdulla Shahid,  for his sustained efforts in  returning  the General 
Assembly to its pre -pandemic work pace  and his message of hope .   
 
2. Let me also extend my congratulations to you r Excellency Mr. Csaba  Kőrösi, 
on your assumption of the Presidency  of the General Assembly . I am 
gratefully optimistic about your leadership in these unprecedented times.  
 
3. I also commend the Secretary -General, Mr. Antonio Guterres , for galvanizing 
the necessary  multilateral support in search  of solutions to meet  the scale 
and urgency  of current global challenges . His timely submission of the “Our 
Common Agenda”  report , that speaks to strengthening global governance  
with a  focus on a future  agenda driven by multilateral solidarity and 
collective action , is also commendable .  
 
4.  As our world wrestles with an unprecedented and volatile economic outlook 
because  of the lingering effects of the COVID -19 pandemic , and other global 
crises, the theme “A Watershed Moment: Transformative Solutions  to 
Interlocking Challenges ” is most  appropriate and timely .  
 
Mr. President,  
 
5. Our progress towards achieving the global sustainable development goals by 
2030 has been complicated by the  repurposing of global development and 
investment finance, disruptions of production and supply chain s, growing food 
 and energy insecurities, general slow -down s in the economies of nations , and 
the perennial adverse effects of climate change .  
 
6. I call on the global family to be intentional and fair about developing 
innovative development financing products that are free from the  stringent 
restrictions and high transaction costs associated with concessionary loans . 
Multilateral financial instituti ons can de -risk investments that are critical for 
sustainable economic development. Aid must also be aligned with domestic 
development priorities . 
 
Mr. President,  
 
7. The adverse effects of climate change are borderless. Global warming, 
unpredictable weather patterns, rising sea levels,  and land degradation are 
taking a profound toll on global food and water security . There are associated 
governance and stability costs. We are info rmed that Africa faces 
disproportionate risks and costs from climate change.  
 
8. We must  therefore,  be c onsistent in meeting our commitment s to all existing 
international frameworks for addressing climate change . Beyond the usual 
declaratives , we must collaborate on and coordinate mitigation efforts , 
improve infrastructure for early warning systems , invest more in improving the 
management of water resources, promote disaster risk management,  and 
enhance the conservation and protection of natural habitat s. There are also 
opportunities, especially for Africa and Sierra Leone in particular, for just 
energy and just rural agriculture transitions.  
 
9. Fair and accessible multilateral climate financing can catalyse  the global and 
country -specific measures and innovation necessary to build and support 
sustainable climate resilience . Green investing does support sustainable 
 development.  In these efforts, the roles and interests of women and young 
people must be central to climate investments .  
 
10. Sierra Leone  is fully committed to concluding  the Treaty on the Conservation 
and Sustainable use of Marine Biological Diversity of areas beyond National 
Jurisdiction. The BBNJ treaty must  prioritise, among other things, conservation 
measures, fair and equitable sharin g of monetary and non -monetary benefits, 
meaningful capacity development , and the transfer of marine technology.   
 
Mr. President,  
 
11. Human Capital Development is a critical driver of inclusive and sustainable 
economic development. Sierra Leone has increased domestic financing for 
education, provided teaching and learning materials, improved education 
policies and governance . More children, more g irls including  pregnant girls, 
poorer and rural learners, and learners with disabilities  are now in school. But 
we can go beyond these access deficits.  
 
12. As co-Chair of the High -Level Steering Committee on SDG4, and  champion  of 
the Transforming Education Summit during this 77th session of the General 
Assembly , I urge concerted global effort s to address th e learning cris es. We can 
mobilise  innovative financing models , underwrite universal access especially 
for girls and learners with disabilities, promote technology in education, make 
greater investments in foundational literacy and numeracy, address “water, 
sanitation, and hygiene” ( WASH ) and other infrastructure defic its, support 
school feeding programmes, fund technical and vocational training, and 
finance other needs across the full spectrum of the education sector . With 
close cooperation among States , we are confident that we will address the 
learning crisis in our time. 
 Mr. President , 
 
13. To address the global food crisis that is disproportionately affecting least 
developed countries,  Sierra Leone joins the urgent call for action to escalate 
financing to support agriculture and irrigation, enhance food systems and 
nutrition for vulnerable populations, and social protection  for at -risk 
populations. Sierra Leone also associates with calls to ease global supply 
constraints especially for fertilisers, rice, and other agricultural commodities. 
Multilateral support for establishing agricultural development banks that will 
support private agricultural investments and agricultural value -addition will 
promote self -sufficiency and greater resilience in that sector.  
 
14. The COVID -19 pandemic reminds  us that equity, multilateral cooperation, and 
a comprehensive global response are what we need to address health 
emergencies that have a  potential to undermine  global peace, security and 
development. Sierra Leone affirms its  commitment to global efforts a t exploring 
innovative and effective ways to enhance health securities , pandemic 
preparedness, build capacities to respond to health emergencies , and 
enhance greater resilience in healthcare delivery.  
 
15. Sierra Leone believes that multilateral support is urg ently needed to 
complement national efforts at reducing maternal and child mortality; 
preventing epidemics ; tackling tropical and communicable diseases ; building 
healthcare infrastructure and the capacity of healthcare personnel ; and 
strengthening primary healthcare . Efforts at increasing domestic financing of 
healthcare should be supported with increased multilateral financing and 
enhanced cooperation . 
 
16. Sierra Leone remains exclusively committed to the global agenda on “Putting 
women and girls at the cent re” of inclusive and sustainable development . We 
 believe that we cannot deliver on the 2030 agenda on sustainable 
development without the achievement of gender equality and women’s 
empowerment. We must therefore garner multilateral support to achiev e and 
sustain gender equality and the empowerment of wom en in our lifetime.  
 
Mr. President, Excellencies,  
 
17. Sexual violence is a grave threat to justice and the fundamental rights of men, 
women, and children throughout the world. In every corner of the globe, 
sexual assault survivors  are inhibited in hold ing perpetrators accountable and 
access ing empowering health, legal, and economic remedies.  In Sierra Leone, 
we have taken extensive legislative and administrative actions to address 
sexual and gender -based  violence since my declaration of rape as a national 
emer gency in 2019.  
 
18. Last year, before  this august Assembly, I announced that I had directed the 
Permanent Mission of Sierra Leone to the United Nations to sponsor a 
standalone resolution on access to justice for survivors of sexual violence at the 
General Assembly. I called for global solidarity  on this issue , and for the United 
Nations to give all survivors of sexual violence the remedy they deserve.  
 
19. The General Assembly on 2nd September this year, adopted by consensus the 
landmark resolution entitled “ International Cooperation for Access to Justice, 
Remedies and Assistance for Survivors of Sexual Violence ”.  
 
20. The General Assembly has therefore affirmed the sincere and shared belief of 
the global community that sexual violence is condemnable, and that member 
States must take effective action to address it, as well as provide access to 
timely and un -impeded justice through national legislation for victims and 
survivors. 
  
21. As a glo bal community we have signalled our resolve to address this scourge. 
We must now do all we can to implement access to justice and other 
remedies, to ensure  dignity for all survivors of sexual violence.  
 
Mr. President, Excellencies,  
 
22. Small States make up the majority of the membership of the United Nations  
and they are the strongest advocates for the rules -based international system  
that underpins the work of the United Nations. Indeed, small States have served 
as key drafters, negotiators, and thought -leaders on a variety of international 
issues. They have done so diligently through transparency of purpose and 
coalition building across board.  
 
23. In that connection, Sierra Leone proposes to further pursue these values in the  
United Nations  Security Council . I count on the invaluable and resounding 
support of this body for Sierra Leone’s bid for  a non -permanent seat in  the UN 
Security Council for the term 2024 -2025, with elections to be held in June 2023.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
24. My Government reaffirms its commitment to the relevant UN Charter provision 
and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries 
and Peoples as contained in General Assembly resolution 1514. We join the 
call on all parties engaged in t he dialogue on decoloni sation to continue to 
demonstrate good faith and firm commitment to a conclusive and durable 
resolution of all sovereignty disputes.  
 
25. As the Coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten (C -10) on the 
Reform of the Security Council, I am pleased to note  the commendable 
 progress that has been achieved in the intergovernmental negotiations (IGN) 
on the reform of the Security Council. We believe that progress made during 
the 76th Session of the General Assembly is underpinned by the Assembly’s 
acknowledgement of the “wider recognition of, and broader support by 
Member States, for the legitimate aspiration of African countries t o play their 
rightful role on the global stage ”.  
 
26. As Africa  continue s to advocate and canvass support  for the Common African 
Position as espoused in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration , I urge 
Member States to continue to demonstrate their renewed commitment and 
political will towards correcting the historical injustice done to Africa  by 
supporting the reform  of the Security Council to make it a more inclusive, 
democratic, transparent, accountable, legitimate , and efficient  global organ 
that properly reflect s and adequately addresses  the geo -political realities of 
our present and future world.  
 
27.  Sierra Leone  is committed to engaging constructively within the multilateral 
rules -based order  of the United Nations.  Only through  global cooperation can 
we engender and implement transformative solutions to global challenges.   
 
I thank you  for your kind attention.", SLE,2022
 EST_77_2022,"Address by the President of the Republic of Estonia Alar Karis  at the 77th 
United Nations General Assembly  
21.09.2022  
 
Mr President,  
Mr Secretary General,  
Excellences,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
It is my honour to be here today , though  I wish the 
circumstances surrounding my first address  were 
different. A year ago,  Mr. Secretary General presented 
his inspiring report “Our Common Agenda” – outlin ing 
his vision for the next 25 -years of global cooperation, and 
initiated discussions on how to reinvigorate 
multilateralism and achieve sustainable development 
goals.  
 
I support the goals of the report and yet, it is a Herculean 
task, because the world is torn a part; we witness the 
constant brutal violation of the core principles of the UN 
Charter on  every continent ; 
 
2 
 United Nations  itself has become a battlefield where 
some states try to convince the world that the common 
values we all are obliged to  adhere to , do not exist . 
 
The only standard we must follow is the  UN Charter  - our 
unique common promise of peace for all nations large 
and small, a promise of  advancing  fundamental human 
rights, the equal rights of men and women. It is not a 
choice, it is a collective responsibility to ensure that 
peace, justice and human rights prevail.     
 
On 24th of February the Russian Federation, a permanent 
member of the United Nations Security Council, attacked 
a democratic and peaceful sovereign  Ukraine. Russia  
started a war of aggression with a goal to end the 
sovereignty of its neighbour, overthrow its legi timate 
government, exterminate  Ukrainian nation, and 
implement its abusive order , impregnated of imperialism, 
self-interest and dominance. 
 
3 
 Russian invasion , including  the illegal occupation of 
Crimea and Russia`s prior land grabs  in Georgia and 
Moldova d emonstrat e Russia`s total disrespect of 
international law, the rules -based international order  and 
are an assault on  the UN Charter, every value and 
principle the United Nations stands for.  
 
This brutal and unjustified aggression is the most serious 
threat to the global peace and security since the end of the 
Second World War and challen ges the very foundation of 
the U N system , undermining  the security of all members 
of international community .  
 
Some colleagues  are hesitant  to take sides  vis-a-vis 
Russian aggression . Some  argue that this war is between 
Russia and Ukraine . I see the aggressor and the victim . 
Legally as well as morally , there´s only one right side to 
take. Standing in the grey zone encourages the aggressor, 
undermines this organisation and fuels human suffering . 
 
4 
 In recent years we have witnessed devastating human 
suffering in Afghanistan, Myanmar, Yemen, Syria, 
Sahel, and the Horn of Africa, just to name a few. The 
war of aggression of Russia makes finding solutions to 
these conflicts only more difficult. As it  has increased 
food insecurity , adds stress on the global humanitarian 
relief system  and bolsters economic crisis.   
 
Ladies and gentlemen,  
I visited Ukraine two months after the invasion began. 
The site was horrific . I lack  words to describe the 
brutality of this s cene. The face of war is the same 
everywhere.  Its cruel ty will never leave the people who 
must live through this. Wars and conflicts only bring 
horror and misery  to mankind.   
 
As of August 22, the Office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Human Rights has recorded in 
Ukraine over 13 000 civilian casualties with 
approximately 6000 killed and nearly 8000 injured. 
 
5 
 The actual numbers are significantly higher. Each murder 
is another  evidence of the grave violations of 
international law by the aggressor.  
 
In the strongest terms, we condemn the war crimes 
committed by Russia  in Ukrain e. UN Assistant  Secretary 
General on Human Rights report ed to the Security 
Council about credible allegations of forced transfers of 
unaccompanied children to Russian occupied territory, or 
to the Russian Federation.  We have seen mass graves of 
tortured civilians, I wonder, are we living in the XXI 
Century?  
 
Excellences, ladies and gentlemen ,  
I want  to pay tribute to the immeasurable resilience of the 
people of Ukraine.   We grieve for the victims of Russia’s 
aggression and stand with Ukraine in ensuring a future 
for its people and nation . 
 
6 
 This brave nation is fighting for values  set in the UN 
Charter , the noble cause of freedom, democracy and 
human rights.  According to the UN Charter Article 51. 
Helping  Ukraine to protect its right to exist  is our 
collectiv e obligation .  
 
At the same time, i t is disturbing  that the United Nations 
Security Council, a  body  that bears the chief 
responsibility for maintaining international peace and 
security,  has been paralysed and utterly  unable to play its 
role.  
Russia has abused its veto power to block the Council 
from adopting any decisions regarding the grave 
violation of sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. 
The Security Council lies in the heart of the UN , it is 
shameful that , since February 24, it has adopted only one 
statement (6 May 2022 ) on Ukraine . How many 
devastating wars will it take to move forward  the long 
overdue Security Council reform? 
 
7 
 I am grateful that while the Security Council remains 
paralysed  on Russia’s aggression issue , the soul and 
conscience of the  UN, the General Assembly has been 
active and decisive.  I recall  the overwhelming support for 
the UN General Assembly’s resolution on March 2 that 
condemned Russia’s aggression and urged Russia to 
immediately and unconditionally withdraw all of its 
troops from the territory of Ukraine within its 
internationally recognized borders.  
We deplore the Russian Federation’s failure to 
implement this resolution as well as its failure to comply 
with the legally binding order by the International Court 
of Justice of 16 March 2022 , requiring Russia  to 
immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine.  
 
Estonia has always been a strong proponent of curbing 
the absolute veto power , and even more so when it has 
been used to cover war crimes and crimes against 
humanity. 
 
8 
 I am glad that the General Assembly adopted by 
consensus a landmark resolution, the so -called veto 
initiative, which provides the UN General Assembly an 
opportunity to step in, when the UN Security Council is 
unable  to act. The q uestion remains , how can we accept 
that aggressor has a veto power in the Security Council ? 
 
Excellences,  
Conflicts and war bring enormous humanitarian 
crisis . Russia`s aggression has led to an immense need  of 
resources and aid. Nearly 18 million Ukrainians  – 40 per 
cent of the country’s population – are in urgent need of 
humanitarian assistance.  The international support for 
Ukraine has been heart -warming.  
The UN , is busy helping Ukrain ians who  didn´t need our 
help before this aggression . To date, Estonia has sent  
over 20 million EUR in humanitarian aid t o Ukraine. We 
have seen an unprecedented massive support of Ukraine 
from the Estonian private sector, civil society and 
citizens. 
 
9 
 We continue to assist  and work on the reconstruction of 
Ukraine – it needs to begin already now. We call others 
to join us in this.  
 
Conflicts create d immense refugee crisis.  According to 
the UN  Refugee Agency,  the total number of people 
worldwide , who were forced to flee  their homes due to 
conflicts and human rights violations , was 89.3 million in 
2021.  The displacements were driven, for example, by 
the brutality of the Bashar al -Assad regime, conflict in 
the Tigray regio n and the Taliban's takeove r of Kabul.  In 
2022 this number has  already  exceeded  the milestone of 
100 million , increase  is caused by the Russia´s war of 
aggression .  
There are more than 7 million recorded Ukrainian 
refugees across Europe , another 7 million have been 
internally displaced. Estonia has received nearly 55,000 
refugees, 4 percent of our country's population. We 
ensure  social services and basic education to refugee ´s 
feeing from war . 
 
10 
 Estonia  has created 1,000 additional places in  different  
education programs for Ukrainian refugee children by 
opening a new school - The Freedom School. One day, 
its students  will be the leaders and rebuilders of Ukraine. 
Estonian education technology companies are donating 
their solutions to support Ukrainian schools and pupils 
whose education has be en disrupted by the war.  
 
Why am I telling all this? Because o ur future depends on 
the youth sitting in the classrooms and on their 
education . We are made by history,  we cannot let the 
lack of knowledge to define our future. To avoid such a 
brutality repeat  itself  we have to raise awareness of the  
history of our nations . We need to evade confusions  
caused by the active brainwash  and disinformation . We 
see how ignorance makes it easy for any aggressor to put 
forward its false narratives. 
 
11 
 War and conflict, lack of openness bring along 
extreme violations of human rights.  It must be clear 
that basic human rights are universal, same for all UN 
members and  cannot be ignored by any government.  
Special attention should be devoted to  ensuring gender 
equality  and right  to education . Opportunity to study 
should not be a wish or a dream at the 21st century .  
 
Let me use this tribune to praise the courageous women 
who have now become the forefront of protest against the 
Taliban  in Afghanistan  to fight for their right  to choose 
their own path and role in the society. It is our profound 
duty to support their struggle . I call on de facto leaders of 
Afghanistan to immediately stop harassing the UNAMA 
Afghan female staff. Respecting universal human rights 
is not a choice. N either culture nor religion can be 
invoked to justify human rights violations. 
 
12 
 In the same vein w e welcome the release of the 
assessment report of human rights situation  in Xinjiang 
by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human 
Rights. The report underscores the serious human rights 
violations occurring in Xinjiang, which, may constitute 
international crimes, in particular, crimes against 
humanity. This is extremely  alarming and requires urgent 
attention by the international community.  
 
Ladies and gentlemen,  
There remains little dispute over the existential crisis 
posed by climate change. We witness ed devastating 
flooding in Pakistan caused by erratic monsoon rains. In 
solidarity with the people of Pakistan, Estonia provides 
help to those severely affected. Russia´s aggression also 
brings further pain to those already suffering from the 
impacts of the pandemic, conflicts, famine and climate 
change. 
 
13 
 Let me be very clear , this aggression has brought high 
inflation, global food and energy crisis.  The head of the 
UN World Food Programme has warned that the Russia’s 
aggression will lead to the worst food crisis since World 
War II. In physics and in life the cause trigge rs a reaction. 
Russia ´s aggression triggered the global food and 
inflation cris is. We have witnessed Russia´s occupying 
forces steal ing Ukraine's grain supplies, burn ing down 
warehouses and destroy ing grain fields.  
Marke t disruptions  are not caused by sanctions , global 
food and economic crisis are caused by the war Russia 
started and Russia can end all this by ending the war . Yet, 
Russia has no intention to end the war . Instead Russian 
regime decided to  escalate. We find its cynical n uclear 
threat totally unacceptable and it is a threat to global 
community.  
 
To alleviate th e crisis, the EU has launched the EU -
Ukraine “solidarity lanes” initiative , it has  helped to 
export over 6 million tonnes of predominantly 
agricultural goods  from Ukraine. 
 
14 
 Estonia also welcomes the Black Sea Grain Initiative that 
was signed in Istanbul on 2 2 July brokered  by the UN 
Secretary -General  and President of Türkiye . We must 
keep the  international pressure on Russia  to monitor 
Russia’s adherence to the deal  and its extension .   
 
Excellences,  
We follow with deep concern  the situation in  one of the 
world´s largest  Zaporizhzhia  Nuclear Power Plant . 
Russia has occupied the plant and turned  it into a combat 
zone . The risk of a nuclear disaster is very real. This 
Power  Plant should  be demilitarized without delay, and 
full control of the plant returned to Ukraine.  
Moreover, it is essential to grant IAEA experts a 
persistent  and unfetter ed access to the facilities of the 
power plant. I regret, that last month, Russia also 
shamelessly blocked the consensus concerning the 
outcome document of the Review Conference of the 
Treaty on the Non -Proliferation.

 Estonia has been vocal in addressing the issues of 
cybersecurity in the UN . We will continue these efforts 
to elevate cybersecurity as an essential component of the 
UN`s international peace and security agenda. Russia has 
demonstrated how state -provided malicious cyber tools 
are used alongside conventional weapons.  Russia`s  
cybe rattack against the satellite communications  of 
Ukraine  on 23 February, served to prepare and facilitate 
Russia´s  on-the-ground invasion .  
 
Excellences,  
It is our duty to ensure accountability and justice at 
all levels . Impunity breeds  impunity and leads to new 
crimes to be committed . It is of utmost importance that 
there are independent and effective investigations into 
the atrocit y crimes  and crimes of aggression commi tted 
against  Ukraine , also in Syria , Ethiopia  and elsewhere . 
We must  provide justice to victims and bring those 
responsible for atrocities  and genocide  to trial. 
 
16 
 Estonia fully supports the investigation led by the 
International Criminal Court . We give most  serious 
consideration to the establishment of an independent 
special court for the crimes of aggression  and the 
compensati on mechanism  for the damages caused by the 
aggression. We support all initiatives attempting to 
secure accountability .  
 
To conclude,  
The war in Ukraine affects us all . It is our common duty 
to push back the ugly manifestations of imperialism , 
colonialism and racism by Russia . Russia must  
understand that th e road they have taken  is disastrous and 
the war they have started  cannot be won . If we stop 
caring, if we get tired, if we fall into indiffer ence, the 
aggressors and criminals  will only be empowered. This 
is not the world where we want to live nor the world we 
want to leave to the future generations . 
 
17 
 The U nited Nations  is and  remains the cornerstone of our 
multilateral rules -based world order.  Its relevance is put 
to the test we cannot fail. The UN must  emerge from this 
watershed moment stronger, more united, and more 
relevant than ever before.   
 
Finally, let me assure you Estonia continue s to provide 
humanitarian assistance  to most vulnerable around the 
world . Our development cooperation is aimed at 
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, 
increasing  digital cooperation, to create an open  and safe 
digital society for all. We remain a responsible and an 
active partner in the UN, in this crisis and beyond.", EST,2022

 ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
GHANA, 
NANA ADDO DANKWA AKUFO-ADDO,  
AT THE 77TH SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS’ 
GENERAL ASSEMBLY, ON THE THEME “A WATERSHED 
MOMENT: TRANSFORMATIVE SOLUTIONS TO 
INTERLOCKING CHALLENGES”, ON WEDNESDAY, 21ST 
SEPTEMBER, 2019, NEW YORK. 
 
Mr President, I congratulate you on your election to lead us through this 
77th gathering of the General Assembly of the United Nations. I wish you 
the best of luck, as you take on this onerous task at this most difficult 
period of the world.  
 
Mr President, as we would say in Ghana, our world is currently not in a 
good place. The World Bank observed, last Thursday, that the global 
economy was enduring its steepest slowdown since 1970. Two years ago, 
our world came to a thundering halt, as we cowered from a health 
pandemic from an unknown, malicious virus, coupled with a devastating 
global economic pandemic. High budget deficits were no longer concerns 
of only developing nations.  
 
By 2021, COVID-19 had pushed Africa into the worst recession for half a 
century. A slump in productivity and revenues, increased pressures on 
spending and spiralling public debts confronted us without relent.   
 
As we grappled with these economic challenges, Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine burst upon us, aggravating an already difficult situation. It is not 
just the dismay that we feel at seeing such deliberate devastation of cities 
and towns in Europe in the year 2022, we are feeling this war directly in 
our lives in Africa. Every bullet, every bomb, every shell that hits a target 
in Ukraine, hits our pockets and our economies in Africa.  
 
The economic turmoil is global with inflation as the number one enemy 
this year.  It hit a 40-year-high in the US and UK in recent months. There 
is record inflation in the euro zone. Several African countries have inflation 
rates surging three to four times higher than what they were just two 
years ago. In Ghana, we are experiencing the highest inflation for 21 
 years. The high costs of food are hurting the poor, especially the urban 
poor, the most.   
 
Moreover, the spillover from central banks raising interest rates to combat 
inflation has been severe beyond borders, as global investors pull money 
out of developing economies to invest in bonds in the developed world. 
This has led to depreciating currencies and increased borrowing costs; 
meaning we need to raise and spend more of our own currencies to 
service our foreign debts in US dollars.  
 
It has become clear, if ever there was any doubt, that the international 
financial structure is skewed significantly against developing and 
emerging economies like Ghana. The avenues that are opened to powerful 
nations to enable them take measures that would ease pressures on their 
economies are closed to small nations. To make matters worse, credit 
rating agencies have been quick to downgrade economies in Africa, 
making it harder to service our debts. The tag of Africa as an investment 
risk is little more than, in substance, a self-fulfilling prophecy created by 
the prejudice of the international money market, which denies us access 
to cheaper borrowing, pushing us deeper into debts.  
 
The financial markets have been set up and operate on rules designed for 
the benefit of rich and powerful nations, and, during times of crisis, the 
façade of international co-operation, under which they purport to operate, 
disappears. These are the savage lessons that we have had to take in, as 
the world emerged from the grip of the coronavirus to energy and food 
price hikes, and a worldwide rise in the cost of living. The necessity for 
reform of the system is compelling.    
 
Mr President, I am a modest student of history, and I would say it is 
doubtful that any generation of inhabitants of this earth has ever 
witnessed such a perfect storm of global economic chaos, a war with 
global consequences, and an unwillingness or inability to find a consensus 
to deal with the catastrophe.  
 
It is under such circumstances that we have gathered under the theme: 
“A Watershed Moment: Transformative Solutions to Interlocking 
Challenges.” 
 The problems we face are, indeed, many, and vary in level of importance, 
depending on where you are in the global order of things. Just last year, 
the focus was on energy transition. This year, it is about energy security, 
as Europe goes back to burning coal to replace Russian gas. Nevertheless, 
we do not have the luxury of being able to pick and choose which big 
problem to solve. None of them can wait; the economic turbulence 
requires urgent and immediate solution; the turmoil and insecurity in 
many parts of the world require urgent attention; and so does the need 
to tackle the problems posed by climate change. 
 
A watershed moment, indeed, it is, and history will judge us harshly if we 
do not seize the opportunity to make the changes that will enable us deal 
with the many problems we face.  
 
Mr President, a case in point is the destabilising conflict in the Sahel. It 
might look to many, today, as a local conflict which affects only the 
countries in that region. We, in Ghana, know differently, we have watched 
in horror as the unrest has moved from the Sahel, inexorably, to the West 
African coastal countries. All of Ghana’s neighbours have suffered terrorist 
attacks, and some have lost territorial space to the invading forces. 
Furthermore, the terrorist pressure has provided a pretext for the 
unhappy reappearance of military rule in three (3) of the fifteen (15) 
member ECOWAS Community, two (2) of whom have borne the brunt of 
the terrorist outrages in the Region – Mali and Burkina Faso. It is a 
development we are determined to reverse, so that the ECOWAS space 
remains a democratic one. 
 
All of us in the Region are being forced to spend huge amounts of money 
on security. This is money we should be spending on educating and giving 
skills to our young people; on building much needed roads, bridges, 
hospitals and other such infrastructure, which we are spending to fight 
terrorists or to keep them out from destabilising our countries. This is a 
global problem, deserving the attention of the world community for a 
global solution.  
 
Mr President, I am contributing to this debate on a date that has special 
significance for us in Ghana. 21st September is the date we mark the birth 
of our first President, Dr Kwame Nkrumah. He would have been one  
hundred and thirteen (113) years old today, and it is worth recalling on 
this day the driving force of his political career, which was to contribute 
to the birth of a united Africa, i.e., a United States of Africa. 
 We recognise today, more than ever before, the importance of the 
strength in unity of Africa, and we are working to shed that image of a 
helpless, hapless continent. 
 
There is a renewed commitment towards an inclusive and sustainable 
industrialisation and economic integration and  the intensity of the 
challenges we face today is only matched, like never before, by the 
immensity of the opportunity before us. We, the current leaders of Africa, 
should be determined not to waste the crisis that confronts us.   
 
Incidentally, 2022 is billed as Africa’s Year to take action on food and 
nutrition development goals. We see the current geopolitical crisis as an 
opportunity to rely less on food imports from outside the continent and 
use better our sixty per cent global share of arable lands to increase food 
production. We have seen the devastating impact of relying on Russia and 
Ukraine for seventy per cent of our wheat consumption. We have enough 
land, enough water, enough gas and enough manpower to produce 
enough fertiliser, food and energy for ourselves and for others.  
 
But, we also recognise that we cannot do it all by ourselves. Our message 
to the global investor community is, therefore, this: Africa is ready for 
business. Africa needs you and you need Africa. You need Africa because 
Africa is busily building the world’s largest single market of 1.3 billion 
people. Soon we will have a customs union, and soon we will have a 
continental payment system that will accelerate and facilitate trade 
amongst ourselves. Already, goods and services are flowing more freely 
across our artificial borders. See Africa for what it is: the new frontier for 
manufacturing, for technology, for food production.  
 
That is why six years ago, I launched in Ghana the successful policy of 
‘One District One Factory’. A policy, with government incentives, that has 
directly seen, so far, some one hundred and twenty-five (125) factories 
being set up in various districts across the country, leveraging on each 
area’s competitive advantage. That is why, six years ago, my government 
embarked on an aggressive policy of planting for food and jobs, which 
has helped our farmers increase their yields in folds. Indeed, we are 
recognising that many of the things we import can be found or produced 
in Ghana, or in other African countries.  
 
The African Continental Free Trade Area, whose Secretariat is located in 
Accra, Ghana’s capital, is driving intra-Africa trade and creating an 
 unparalleled momentum for our continent’s economic diversity and 
transformation. We know  that industrialisation is the way to go and, with 
the single market as the added incentive, we have taken policy measures 
in Ghana to add value to our natural resources. For example, we are 
processing more of our cocoa, refining more of our gold, and we are 
determined to exploit the entire value chain of our huge lithium deposits. 
We are busily building an integrated bauxite and aluminium industry and 
an integrated iron and steel industry, building new oil refineries and have, 
so far, attracted six (6) of the world’s biggest automobile manufacturers 
to set up assembling plants in Ghana, prior to producing them in the 
country.  
 
In line with the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the United Nation’s 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Africa’s ambition is to transform 
our food systems over the next decade, anchored in the Comprehensive 
Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) and the Malabo 
Declaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth. What we require now is  
support from the investor community for the rolling out of Africa’s 
lucrative agro-industry, and for the community to see agribusiness in 
Africa as much more an opportunity than the perceived, exaggerated risk 
which has been the false, but dominant narrative.  
  
In conclusion, Mr President, on 25 July 2016, the United Nations General 
Assembly adopted Resolution A/RES/70/293, proclaiming 2016-2025 as 
the Third Industrial Development Decade for Africa (IDDA III), with 
UNIDO tasked to lead it in collaboration with a range of partners. I believe 
it is time for the UN to take proper stock of this initiative and ask a few 
searching questions, recognising what could have been achieved with 
greater commitment and focus.  
 
Working together, we can get our world back into a better and happier 
place. 
 
I thank you very much for your attention.", GHA,2022

Address by  
 His Excellency President of the Republic of Ca bo Verde,  
Mr. José Maria Pereira Neves,  
at the General Debate of the  
77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  on the theme:  
 
""A Watershed Moment: Transformative Solutions to Interlocking 
Challenges ” 
 
New York, 21 September 2022 
 
 
Excellencies . Heads of State, Government and Delegation s. Mr. President of the 
General Assembly . Mr. Secretary General. Dear  Delegates . Ladies and Gentlemen  
 
The Republic of Cabo Verde encompasses  the inhabitants of the 10 islands that 
make up the  national territory, located in the Mid -Atlantic, off the West African 
coast, and an immense diaspora, our 11th island, scattered throughout  the four 
corners of the world.  
 
As President of the Republic and Highest Representative of this global Nation, I 
have the enormous privilege of extending my greeting s to all of you  and, from the 
pulpit  of this august assembly, to bring  mantenhas  - greetings  in the  Mother tongue 
of Ca bo Verde - from  Cabov erdeans to the Peoples of the World, represented here 
by their highest dignitaries, auguring the best wishes for prosperity and happiness 
shared by all.  
 
We look forward, with hope, to the Summit of the Future in 2023, as foreseen in 
the Secretary General's proposal of Our Common Agenda , so that it may effectively 
help “forge a new global consensus on what our future should look like, and what 
we can do tod ay to secure it ”. 
 
With this in mind,  Cabo Verde reiterates before this August Assembly  its firm 
purpose of continuing to be an active and useful Member of the United Nations 
System, acting and articulating its action on four major fronts ,  from more speci fic 
to broader: to fully own up to its responsibility in the framework of national 
governance ; to value its specificity and grow from its status as a Small Island State 
in Development ; to be a spokesperson in the context of the diversity and the 
designs of Africa, the continent to which it belongs and, ultimately , continue to be a 
champion  of Multilateralism for the advancement of the causes of progress and 
well -being of Humanity. 
 
In their journey, SIDS face structural limitations such as geographical remoteness 
and isolation, the ir small economic dimension, dependence on imports and high 
costs, on the one hand, and exports of sector -concentrated services, on the other, 
which more frequently and intensely expose them and make them vulnerabl e to 
the impact of external  shocks , whether climate, economic , or of other nature, such 
as pandemi cs and geopolitical conflicts.   
 
My country , Cabo Verde, for example, in the past 15 years, between 2007 and 2022, 
has suffered the economic and social impac t of multiple crises: the economic and 
financial crisis of 2007 – 2008, at the very moment of our graduation from the list 
of LDCs , the COVID 19 pandemic, which caused a recession in 2020 of 14.6%, the 
ongoing inflationary impact, as  well as, in the last five years, one of the most 
profound  and most serious droughts in recent history  of the country .  
  
But like the other Small Island Developing States, Ca bo Verde has the ambition to 
become a Small Island Developed State.  
 
In order to achieve this , Cabo Verde  will have to progressively overcome its 
vulnerabilities and increase its resilience , and for th is, it is imperative to be able to 
count on external solidarity in terms of sustainable financing and indebtedness, 
albeit always in a process and in a logic of gradual reduction of the need for 
external support . 
 
Although  this is not a new  narrative , it is, nevertheless  urgent that it be 
implemented, since with less than eight years to go before the 2030 Agenda target , 
all signs show that the indicators are not at the desirable pace toward achieving  
the Sustainable Development Goals by  that date.  
 
It is also pressing because less than two years before the Fourth SIDS Conference 
in 2024, it is certainly  legitimate and expected that the Conference  may  make a 
 
transformative decision on the best evaluation indicators and on the policy 
modalities that will best support SIDS in meeting the Samoa Pathway goals .    
 
Cabo Verde has already submitted its applicat ion to host , in 2023 , the regional 
preparatory meeting of the AIS – the SIDS region of the Atlantic and Indic oceans 
and the South China Sea, to which it belongs, and is also prepared to monitor and 
support the whole process u p to the conclusion of the Gen eral Conference in 2024.  
 
It is with in this context of emergency that we welcome the Secretary -General's 
recommendation and the decision of the President of the General Assembly to 
establish a United Nations High -Level Expert Panel to conduct the work s, 
including the completion and use of a Multidimensional Vulnerability Index 
(MVI).  We look forward to  a satisfactory conclusion of the work s of the High -
Level  Panel, in particular that the General Assembly may adopt its MVI  proposal 
which we hope shall  be accepted and used in a consensual manner both inside and 
outside the United Nations.  
 
After all, we, the Small Island Developing States, also want to free ourselves from 
the dependence on external support, which necessarily entail s reduc ing our 
vulnerabil ities, while also being aware of the duty to do our homework, to be 
competitive and resilient , and to achieve inclusive and environmentally 
sustainable growth . 
 
Since 2015, Africa's cultural and natural, material  and immaterial  heritage has been 
celebrated around the world to raise awareness and sensibility  on the importance 
of its preservation. Hence , the African Union proposed as the theme for the year 
2021 “Arts, Culture , and Heritage: Levers to build the Africa we Want ”. How ever, 
in this regard, there are still concerns about the urgencies and the measures to be 
taken. 
 
In my capacity as President , and counting on my African counterparts, I propose 
to invest in the Preservation of the Natural and Cultural Heritage of the who le of 
Africa, and to reflect on how to promote climate justice and equity in Africa and 
for Africa. It is a question of seeking to reach consensus on a more flexible and less 
abstract notion of climate equity that places  common but differentiated 
responsib ilities at the heart of a public and global debate, and to create a common 
platform for Africa with view to a transfer of responsibilities on an 
intergenerational basis.  
 
On this occasion, I must refer to  the worldwide movement of the candidacy  of Creolization  
and Creole cultures as World Heritage, for which I have accepted to be Sponsor  and 
Spokesperson, were it not for Ca bo Verde being t he first Creole society in the world.  
 
This is a civil society -led initiative, which wants creole countries  to b e able to 
position themselves, under  one voice, regarding  their intangible heritage, 
promoting peace, friendship between peoples and development cooperation, 
based on the values that Creolization  has brought to civilization: a new  ethos  based 
on tolerance,  diversity,  and fusion of cultures. We therefore call for strong political 
support and engagement from dignitaries  from Creole countries and their Heads 
of State.  
 
The adoption of the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs was a high point for 
Multilateralism, and its p rogressive implementation and realization should 
continue to benefit from the impetus of an increasingly renewed, reinvigorated 
Multilateralism anchored on the United Nations System . 
 
This has not happened at the desired level on the various fronts where, 
unfortunately, global challenges remain, while at the same time crises have 
emerged  and which have constituted genuine obstacles to progress, endangering 
the desired reinvigoratin g of Multilateralism adapted  and prepared to deal with 
the scale and complexity of the new challenges. 
 
 
In this sense, Cabo Verde advocate s for an effective, inclusive, preventive, 
dissuasive and cooperative Multilateralism, which could , as has already been  
stated,  establish, “a new global agreement between States”, as well as ""a new 
global governance"" of the international system.  
 
A Multilateralism that calls for less confrontation between blocs and more 
cooperation among  Member States in the construction and delivery of global 
public goods to all, such as  Peace and Security, Human Rights and Sustainable 
Development.   
 
Ultimately, a  Multilateralism that is useful and a facilitator  of an appeased 
international context, which opens the doors for  countries , such as Ca bo Verde, to 
more external f unding  and more and better integration in the regional and global 
value chains.   
 
In concluding, I wish  you fruitful deliberat ions during th is 77th Session of the 
General Assembly , the results of which we hope may pave the way and prepare 
the Summits of the Future and of SIDS in 2023 and 2024.  
 
The Future lies in each  day that lays  ahead, but also in the solutions we take and 
that we make possible in each of these days.  Our best wishes to the United Nations .   
 
Thank you , very much!", CPV,2022

His Majesty, King Mswati III  
Head of State of the Kingdom of Eswatini  
at the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly  
General Debate  
New York  
21 September 2022  
 
 
Mr. President,  
Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Government,  
United Nations Secretary -General  
Distinguished Delegates,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
Introduction,  
It is a great honour for me to address this distinguished 77th United Nations General 
Assembly, where we have once again come together as a community  of nations to renew 
our commitment to implementing the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals Agenda.  
 
We are meeting at a time when we have just passed through a stage of tragedies brought 
about by the COVID -19 pandemic, which has claimed lives all over the world. We thank 
God that this period is subsiding.  
 
We must praise the countries of the world for uniting to fight this pandemic up to this stage 
where it is on the verge of being eradicated. The development and supply of COVID -19 
vaccines has proven to be  very useful, especially with regard to the prevention 
interventions.  
 
We also applaud the United Nations for being instrumental in working under extremely 
difficult conditions. It re mained resolute in assisting countries, and it is safe to say we are 
wher e we are today because of their efforts. Despite these challenges, it is encouraging to 
think that there were some positives to take away from this experience.  
 
In the case of Eswatini, we were compelled to develop testing laboratories and oxygen 
storage f acilities, which are now very helpful in the fight against other health issues.  
 
We have witnessed the availability of oxygen, which has been used in saving the lives of 
snake bite victims, among other medical emergencies. 
 
 
HIV and AIDS Milestones  
The COVID pandemic arrived in the midst of an HIV/AIDS pandemic, which we were still 
battling with, and it affected various programmes that had been put in place. Eswatini has 
made great strides in the fight against HIV and AIDS.  
 
The country became a shining example for the continent and the world at large after it 
attained the 95 -95-95 UNAIDS treatment cascade targets in 2020. We are now focused on 
ending the AIDS pandemic as a global health threat by 2030.  
 
This milestone would never  have been possible without the support of the development 
partners who have been with the country since 1986  when the first AIDS case was 
announced.  
 
On-going Conflicts and Tensions in the World  
Mr. President, it is unfortunate that even after COVID, when  we were beginning to say that 
there is hope, we are now confronted with the conflicts that are taking place all over the 
world. Their consequences include, among other things, the loss of life.  
 
These conflicts and tensions have also contributed significa ntly to the rise in flood prices 
globally. They are not unique to a certain area, as they persist in Africa, Europe, Asia and 
the Middle East.  
 
We hope to see an end to these clashes through peaceful resolutions. We must applaud the 
United Nations for its efforts to prevent these conflicts from escalating. Hopefully, there will 
be long -lasting, fruitful results emerging from these United Nations interventions.  
 
Living Up to Founding United Nations Objectives  
As we gather here at the United Nations, we are a ll reminded of the main purpose of 
establishing the organization, which was to reduce tensions that lead to conflict around the 
world.  
 
We hope the aspirations of our forefathers will guide us in using the organization to bring 
us together, so that we can resolve our differences where they exist and find lasting 
solutions. This will, no doubt, be of great help to all mankind.  
 
Attainment of SDGs 2030  
These problems are a setback to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which are on -
going, given that COVI D has had a negative impact while the conflicts are also taking their 
own toll on these programmes. 
 
During the pandemic, we witnessed the collapse of many economies, the shutdown of 
industries, and a disruption of poverty alleviation projects that could not be implemented 
properly due to all the prevention measures, which meant there was no movement of p eople 
and goods.  
 
Nevertheless, now that COVID is subsiding, it is high time for all of us to once again renew 
our focus on the SDGs and implement them, as they will play a crucial role in helping our 
countries develop.  
 
Role of Financial Institutions in Rebuilding Economies  
We also note the importance of the role that needs to be played b y financial institutions in 
assisting countries in the recovery process, as most countries really suffered a lot 
economically and financially, which means  they face challenges in raising resources to fund 
this process.  
 
We hope and urge our financial institutions to remain open to receiving countries that need 
support to revive their developmental programmes, to welcome their requests with 
sympathy to the p light of the challenges that they faced during the troubling COVID and 
HIV/AIDS challenges.  
 
We do appreciate that in recent days, we have seen the financial multilateral organizations 
become more welcoming towards countries in need of budget support.  
 
We trust the world will continue to come together to resolve these challenges as countries 
have a great strain on their resources, a situation that will be felt for some time to come. We 
hope the world will come together to contribute to resolving some of the se problems.  
 
Global Challenges Affecting Mankind  
Our theme for this 77th session of the General Assembly is “A Watershed Moment: 
Transformative Solutions to Interlocking Challenges”.  
 
The theme fits very well with the several issues we are facing in the world today. The 
Kingdom of Eswatini, like all other Member States, has not been immune to these encounters 
that have heightened pressure on our already stressed economies.  
 
They have served to derail us from our pursuit of the United Nations Sustainab le 
Development Goals Agenda 2030 and the African Union Aspiration 2063 – The Africa We 
Want.  
 
The theme should, therefore, serve to kick -start our economies towards recovery and enable 
us to create a sustainable future for our people. 
 
 
Availing Investment Opportunities  
As the Kingdom of Eswatini, we are continuing with our efforts to attract investment and 
to support small medium enterprises as well as create big industries. In doing so, we realize 
the need for reliable energy to help us achieve our investm ent goals, so it is one of the areas 
we are working on developing, as a region.  
 
We are also focussed on remaining highly competitive, which is why the world bank ease 
of doing business ranks us at the top in Africa when it comes to trading across borders.  
 
The Government has also put in place fiscal support measures to ensure the cost of 
establishment of businesses and initial operational costs are reduced drastically through a 
range of options from fiscal to non -fiscal incentives.  
 
The creation of special economic zones has placed us at an advantage to leverage our export 
potential through attracting export -oriented manufacturing projects.  
 
Eswatini is also well positioned as a launch pad to the African Continental Free Trade Area 
(ACFTA ), which seeks to boost intra – Africa trade with a market of 1.2 billion people and a 
combined GDP of $2.2 trillion.  
 
The country is also engaged in creating opportunities for our youth to address the issue of 
unemployment and poverty. There are oppo rtunities to be explored in areas of ICT, 
agriculture and the informal sector, to name but a few.   
 
Mr. President,  the Kingdom of Eswatini welcomes the new programme by the UNDP to 
support our youth in Africa who want to engage in entrepreneurship to mitigate the issues 
of poverty. This is a noble idea, and we are ready to embrace it . 
 
Food Security  
Food security and ending hunger remain a priority for the Government of the Kingdom of 
Eswatini . We are deploying a double -pronged stra tegy to address this challenge by 
providing social safety nets for the most vulnerable groups.  
 
We have increased budget allocations, engaged in emergency food aid distribution, 
providing cash transfers to the elderly and vulnerable, school feeding program mes and 
other support services for disadvantaged populations.  
 
With regard to agriculture growth and development, the key projects driven by these public 
investments , include the acceleration of water harvesting and irrigation development, 
where an average of 1,000 hectares is developed with irrigation every year. 
 
We are also creating market -linked agriculture growth opportunities for small and 
emerging farmers to pro duce and generate income to enhance their livelihoods.  
 
The negative effects of climate change are compelling the government to build more dams 
throughout the kingdom for irrigation. Other initiatives include the rollout of input 
subsidies for staple food crops.  
 
The combination of these programmes has also increased the production of maize, our 
staple food, by 30% for the 2021 –2022 farming season, only 9% short of our national target.  
 
Reform of the UN Security Council  
With global stability at stake, Africans have recognized the need to guard against 
opportunists who seek to take advantage of the fragile economies to advance their agendas.   
 
Ours is a history littered with problems of the past and ongoing attempts to re -infiltrate our 
countries through covert and overt means.  
 
Eswatini is of the ardent belief that Africa must have permanent representation in the United 
Nations Security Council (UNSC); a call made in the Ezulwini Consensus in 2005.  
 
Our position emanates from the fact that every democracy has its exceptionality and that 
societies are founded according to different cultural norms and values. We will not tire of 
the consideration and belated adoption of this call by the un to bring in the proper 
perspective on the African polity.  
 
Taiwan Participation in UN System   
When the world faced the COVID pandemic, it must be noted that no country was spared, 
which means we all needed to come together to find solutions.  
 
Unfortunately, Taiwan was unable to access some of the World Health Organization's 
(WHO ) programmes and thus implement the remedies that required their approval.  
 
We continue to appeal for Taiwan to be considered for full participation in the un agencies. 
We are confident that the global village would benefit substantially from Taiwan's 
meaningful participation in the UN system.   
 
The Kingdom of Eswatini calls upon the United Nations to make the necessary 
arrangements for Taiwan to significantly participate  in relevant un specialized agencies and 
mechanisms.  
 
Conclusion  
Mr. President , as I conclude, Eswatini remains confident in the global body's capability to 
confront and overcome the challenges we face because most of them are manmade. 
 
We can achieve this through our full commitment to the ideals of the United Nations 
Charter. This time, history is calling on each member state to intensify efforts to address our 
plight if we envisage triumphantly walking the path to 2 030.  
 
However, and most im portantly, we must remain certain about one important thing; our 
success hinges on unity and respect for one another, which is key to all the outcomes of this 
77th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Despite our diversity, we are one big 
family . 
 
We need to give the world and our people hope and confidence that the United Nations has 
the entire mandate to play its role in all global issues that affect mankind.  
 
I thank you  — May the Almighty God bless us all .", SWZ,2022
 UKR_77_2022,"STATEMENT  
by President  of Ukraine  H.E. Mr. Volodymyr  Zelenskyy  
at the General  Debate  of the 77th  session  of the UNGA  
(21 September,  2022,  New  York)  
 
 
 Greetings  to all people  of the world  who  value  peace  and unity  between  
different  and equal  nations!  I wish  you all peace!  
 I thank  you that we are united  in our striving  to restore  peace  and to guarantee  
peace  for any nation  that has become  a victim  of the armed  aggression.  
 A crime  has been  committed  against  Ukraine,  and we demand  just punishme nt. 
 The crime  was committed  against  our state  borders.  The crime  was committed  
against  the lives  of our people.  The crime  was committed  against  the dignity  of our 
women  and men.   
 The crime  was committed  against  the values  that make  you and me a 
community  of the United  Nations.  
 And Ukraine  demands  punishment  for trying  to steal  our territory.  Punishment  
for the murders  of thousands  of people.  Punishment  for tortures  and humiliations  of 
women  and men.   
 Punishment  for the catastrophic  turbulence  that Russi a provoked  with  its illegal  
war and not only  for us, Ukrainians,  but for the whole  world.  For every  nation  that is 
represented  in this Hall of the UN General  Assembly.  
 I am speaking  on behalf  of the state,  which  is forced  to defend  itself,  but has 
the formula  for peace.  I am speaking  to everyone  who  wants  to hear  how  to achieve  
peace.   
 I will present  a formula  that can work  not only  for us, but for anyone  who  may  
find themselves  in similar  circumstances  as we did. It is a formula  that punishes  crime,  
protects  life, restores  security  and territorial  integrity,  guarantees  security,  and 
provides  determination.   
 There  are five preconditions  for peace.  
 
Dear  Mr. President  of the General  Assembly!   
Dear  Secretary -General  of the United  Nations!   
Dear  heads  of states  and governments!   
Dear  journalists!   
Nations  of the world!  
 
 Ukraine  wants  peace.  Europe  wants  peace.  The world  wants  peace.  And we 
have  seen  who  is THE ONLY  ONE  who  wants  war. 
 There  is only  one entity  among  all UN Member  States  who  would  say now , if he 
could  interrupt  my speech,  that he is happy  with  this war – with  his war.  But we will 
not let this entity  prevail  over  us, even  though  it is the largest  state  in the world.  
 Ukraine  showed  strength  on the battlefield,  using  its right  to self-defens e in 
accordance  with  Article  51 of the UN Charter.  And no one will reproach  us now  or in 
the future  with  weakness  or inability  to fight  for ourselves,  for our independence.   
 We are achieving  a result  in this fight  and we see what  the end of this war will 
be, and what  will be the guarantees  of a stable  peace.  
 The UN Charter  proclaims  the equality  of nations  – and we proved  that Ukraine  
is equal  among  the equals.   
 The UN Charter  protects  the inviolability  of borders  – and we confi rm our state  
borderline  by expelling  the occupiers  outside.   
 The UN Charter  stipulates  the value  of human  rights,  dignity  and life, and we 
also stipulate  them  – with  every  Ukrainian  city freed  from  Russian  occupation.  
 We did not provoke  this war.  We held  88 rounds  of talks  in various  formats  to 
prevent  this war,  just from  the beginning  of my presidency  until  February  24 this year.  
 But Russia  – instead  of stopping  the crime  of aggression,  which  it started  back  
in 2014  – turned  it into a full-scale  invasion.  And we have  no choice  but to defend  
ourselves.  We do it. We push  the aggressor  beyond  the internationally  recognized  
border  of the Ukrainian  state.  
 And this is the first item  of our peace  formula.  Comprehensive  item.  
Punishment.   
 Punishment  for the crime  of aggression.  Punishment  for violation  of borders  
and territorial  integrity.  Punishment  that must  be in place  until  the internationally  
recognized  border  is restored.  Until  the aggression  stops.  And until  the damages  and 
losses  for the war are fully  compensated.  
 Therefore,  sanctions  against  the aggressor  are a part of the peace  formula.  
Blocking  the trade  and relations  with  the aggressor  is a part of the peace  formula.  All 
this is a punishment.  
 So long  as the aggressor  is a party  to decision -making  in the international  
organizations,  he must  be isolated  from  them – at least  until  aggression  lasts.  Reject  
the right  to vote.  Deprive  delegation  rights.  Remove  the right  of veto  – if it is a 
Member  of the UN Security  Council.  In order  to punish  the aggressor  within  the 
institutions.  
 We should  not turn  a blind  eye to propagandists  who  justify  aggression,  but 
apply  a full package  of personal  restrictions  against  them.  That  is a punishment  for 
lying.  
 Citizens  of the aggressor  state  should  not be allowed  to enjoy  tourism  or 
shopping  in the territory  of those  who  value  peace,  but should  be encouraged  through  
visa restrictions  to fight  against  the aggression  of their  own  state.  Punish  for abetting  
the evil. 
 A Special  Tribunal  should  be created  to punish  Russia  for the crime  of 
aggression  against  our state.  This will become  signal  to all “would -be” aggressors,  that 
they  must  value  peace  or be brought  to responsibility  by the world.  
 We have  prepared  precis e steps  to establish  such  Tribunal.  They  will be 
presented  to all states.  
 Ukraine  will appeal  to the UN General  Assembly  to support  an international  
compensation  mechanism.   
 We count  on your  support.   
 Russia  should  pay for this war with  its assets.  It is also a punishment.  This is one 
of the most  terrible  punishments  for Russian  officials,  who  value  money  above  
everything  else.  
 The second  item  of the peace  formula  is the protection  of life. The most  
concrete  item.  
 Now,  while  the sessions  of the General  Assembly  continue,  in the Ukrainian  
town  of Izyum,  Kharkiv  region,  the exhumation  is under  way...  of bodies  from  a mass  
burial,  which  happened  when  the territory  was controlled  by Russian  troops.  The 
bodies  of women  and men,  children  and adults,  civilians  and soldiers  were  found  
there.  445 graves.   
 There  is a family  that died  under  the rubble  of a house  after  a Russian  airstrike  
– father,  mother,  6- and 8-year -old girls,  grandparents.  There  is a man  who  was 
strangled  with  a rope.  There  is a woman  with  broken ribs and wounds  on her body.  
There  is a man  who  was castrated  before  the murder,  and this is not the first case.  
 Ask, please,  the representatives  of Russia  why the Russian  military  are so 
obsessed  with  castration.  What  was done  to them  so that they  want  to do this to 
others?  
 The only  thing  that differs  the mass  burial  in Izyum  from  what  the world  saw in 
Bucha  is, in fact,  the burial.  The Russian  army  was in Izyum  for a longer  time,  and 
therefore  the bodies  of the killed people  were  buried,  and not scattered  on the 
streets.  
 So, how  can we allow  the Russian  army  somewhere  on Ukrainian  soil, knowing  
that they  are committing  such  mass  murders  everywhere?  We cannot.  
 We must  protect  life. The world  must  protect  life. Every  state  suffering  the 
armed  aggression  needs  the opportunity  to protect  its citizens  and liberate  its 
territory.  
 If it requires  help  with  weapons  or shells  – they  should  be provided.  If you need  
financial  help  for this,  it should  be given.  If for this,  it is necessary  to help  with  the 
intelligence  data  – just do it. But what  is not needed , is lies. 
 We can return  the Ukrainian  flag to our entire  territory.  We can do it with  the 
force  of arms.   
 But we need  time.   
 We tried  to speed  it up. We tried  to impleme nt the basic  provisions  of the UN 
Charter  for Ukraine  through  negotiations. 
 But Russia  is afraid  of real negotiations  and does  not want  to fulfill  any fair 
international  obligations.  It lies to everyone.  As it is typical  for aggressors,  for 
terrorists.   
 Even  now,  when  Russia  talks  about  negotiations,  it only  wants  to slow  down  its 
retreat.  Russia  wants  to spend  the winter  on the occupied  territory  of Ukraine  and 
prepare  forces  to attempt  a new  offensive.  New  Buchas,  new  Izyums ... Or at least  it 
wants  to prepare  fortifications  on occupied  land  and carry  out military  mobilization  
at home.  
 We cannot  agree  to a delayed  war.  Because  it will be even  hotter  than  the war 
now.  
 For us, this is a war for life. That  is why we need  defense  support  – weapons,  
military  equipment  and shells.  Offensive  weapons,  a long -range  one is enough  to 
liberate  our land,  and defensive  systems,  above  all, air defense. And we need  financial  
support  – to keep  internal  stability  and fulfill  social  obligations  to our people.   
 Physical  and social  protection  are two elements  of any nation's  life. So, the 
second  item  of our peace  formula  is the protection  of life. By all available  means  – 
allowed  by the UN Charter.  
 The third  item  of our peace  formula  is restoring  security  and territorial  
integrity.   
 Look  at how  many  elements  of global  security  Russia  has undermined  with  its 
war – maritime  safety,  food  safety,  radiation  safety,  energy  safety  and safety  from 
weapons  of mass  destruction.  
 We are already  restoring  maritime  safety  and food  security.  And I thank  Mr. 
Antonio  Guterres  for his personal  involvement.  Algeria,  Ethiopia,  Egypt,  Libya,  Kenya,  
Som alia, Sudan,  Tunisia, Bangladesh,  Israel,  India,  Iran,  Yem en, Cyprus,  China,  Korea,  
Lebanon,  Türkiye,  Belgium,  Bulgaria,  Greece,  Ireland,  Spain,  Italy,  Netherlands , 
Germany,  Romania  and France  have  already  received  Ukrainian  agricultural  products.   
 And we have  to increase  the supply  by sea. Both  under  market  conditions  and 
within  the UN Food  Program,  for which  Ukraine  is always  a reliable  partner.   
 By the way,  despite  all the difficulties  caused  by the war,  we decided  to provide  
humanitarian  aid to Ethiopia  and Somalia,  so we will send  them  an additional  amount  
of our wheat.  
 But it is more  difficult  with  other  security  elements.   
 On the eve of the General  Assembly  meeting,  Russia  fired  missiles  at the South  
Ukraine  Nuclear  Power  Plant.  The explosio n hit the station  buildings  – windows  were  
broken,  walls  were  damaged.  The rockets  exploded  only  three  hundred  meters  from  
the walls  of the reactors!   
 And this is after  the IAEA's  clear  appeal  to Russia  to stop  any hostile  activity  
against  any nuclear  facilities  of Ukraine  and,  in particular,  against  the Zaporizhzhia  
Nuclear  Power  Station  – the largest  one in Europe,  which  Russia  has turned  into a 
target.   
 And that makes  all of you a target. 
 Russian  radiation  blackmailing  is something  that should  concern  each  and every  
one of you,  because  none  of you will find a vaccine  against  radiation  sickness.  
 The cost -of-living  crisis  continues  in dozens  of countries,  it roots  in the 
destabilization  of the energy  market.  It is necessary  to remove  the main  factor  of 
global  price  turbulence,  namely:  Russian  energy  blackmailing.   
 It is necessary  to cap the prices  at which  Russia  exports  its energy  resources.  It 
is necessary  to make  Russian  oil and gas – just ordinary  goods  again.  Currently,  oil and 
gas are Russia’s energy weapons.  And that is why it manipulates  the markets  so that 
electricity,  gas, petrol  and diesel  become  the privilege  of few instead  of being  a 
common  good  available  to all. 
 Limiting  prices  is safeguarding  the world.  This is the way to restore  energy  and 
price  security.   
 But will the world  go for it? Or will it be scared?  Will it be scared  of Russian  
threats?  
 It is necessary  to take  only  one strong  step,  after  which  everything  will become  
clear.  The time  has come  for this.  
 This step  will put everythi ng in place.  After  the Russian  missile  terror.  After  the 
massacres . After  Mariupol.  After  the burning  of Ukrainian  prisoners  in Olenivka  by the 
Russian  military.  After  blocking  the ports.  After  the strikes  of Russian  tanks  and 
missiles  on nuclear  power  plants. And after  threats  to use nuclear  weapons,  which  
have  become  the rule,  not the exception,  for Russian  propag andists...  
 We must  finally  recognize  Russia  as a state  sponsor  of terrorism.  At all levels.  
In all countries  that confess  the values  of peace  and protection  of human  life. Legally.  
Politically.   
 If you don't  have  a legal  mechanism,  you can make  a political  decision  – in the 
parliaments.  This is the foundation  for restoring  global  security.  If this strong  step  is 
taken,  doubts  will disappear  – whether  to take  other  important  steps.  
 And what  is very  sensitive  – is the border,  the territorial  integrity.  
 When  one count ry tries  to steal  the territory  of another  state,  it puts  all world  
nations  under  attack.   
 Global  security  cannot  be restored  without  restoring  the territorial  integrity  of 
the nation  which  suffered  the armed  aggression.  
 So, the third  item  of the Ukraini an peace  formula  is the restoration  of security  
and territorial  integrity.  The fourth  item  is security  guarantees.  
 Every  nation  has the right  to security  guarantees.  Not only  the largest  nations.  
Not only  the most  fortunate  ones.  
 We have  proposals  to upgrade  the security  architecture  for Ukraine,  and for 
Europe  and the world,  which  will not allow  any more  aggression  against  us. We are 
already  presenting  them  to partners.   
 Proposals  for legally  binding  multilateral  and bilateral  treaties . These  are the 
conditions  for the guarantors  to act, and the timeline  for their  actions  to bring  results  
– results  on land,  at sea and in the air; in diplomacy  and politics,  in economy  and 
finance,  in providing  weapons  and intelligence.  Each  of you,  who  will receive  the text 
of our peace  formula  will also see the details  of what  we offer  as security  guarantees.  
 I do not want  to compare  our offers  with  the guarantees  of any alliances  that 
exist  on the planet  now.  I want  to stress  that it is always  much  better  to guarantee  
the security  of a nation,  preventively , rather  than  to stop  a war after  it has already  
begun.  
 And the fifth  item  of the Ukrainian  peace  formula  is determination.  Something  
without  which  the other  four  items  will not work.  
 This is our determination  to fight.  This is the determination  of the partners  to 
help  us, and also themselves.  And this is the determination  of the world  to unite  
around  the one who  fights  against  armed  aggression  and to call to order  the one who  
threatens  all. 
 So, all five items  of our formula:   
 punishment  for aggression;   
 protection  of life;  
 restoration  of security  and territorial  integrity;   
 security  guarante es;  
 and determination  to defend  oneself.  
 This is the formula  of crime  and punishment,  which is already  well known  to 
Russia.  And this is the formula  of justice  and law and order  that Russia  has yet to learn.  
As well as any other  potential  aggressors.  
 What  is not in our formula?  Neutrality.  
 Those  who  speak  of neutrality,  when  human  values  and peace  are under  attack,  
mean  something  else.  They  talk about  indifference  – everyone  for themselves.  Here's  
what  they  say. They  pretend  to be interested  in each  other's  problems.  They  take  care  
of each  other  formally.  They  sympathize  only  for protocol.  And that is why they  
pretend  to protect  someone,  but in reality,  they  protect  only  their  vested  interests.  
This is what  creates  the conditions  for war.  This is what  needs  to be corrected  in order  
to create  conditions  for peace.  
 All you need  is determinatio n. 
 There  was a lot of talking  about  reforming  the UN. How  did it all end?  No result.  
 If you look  carefully  at our peace  formula,  you will see that its implementation  
is already  becoming  a de-facto  reform  of the United  Nations.  Our formula  is universal,  
and unites  the North  and the South  of the world.  It calls  for the world's  majority,  and 
encourages  to expand  the representation  of those  who  remained  unheard .  
 This is an imbalance  when  Africa,  Latin  America,  most  of Asia,  Central  and 
Eastern  Europe  comply  with  the right  of veto,  that they  themselves  never  had.  
 And this is what  Ukraine  is talking  about.  And have  you ever  heard  such  words  
from  Russia?  But it is a permanent  member  of the Security  Council.  For some  reason.  
For what  reason,  not Japan  or Brazil , not Türkiye  or India,  not Germany  or Ukraine.  
The day will come  when  this will be resolved.  
 As for the talks  between  Ukraine  and Russia. 
 Probably  you have  happened  to hear  different  words  from  Russia  about  the 
talks  – as if they  were  ready  for them.  But. They  talk about  the talks  but announce  
military  mobilization.  They  talk about  the talks  but announce  pseudo  referendums  in 
the occupied  territories.  
 What  is true  then?  The military  mobilization  in Russia  is true.  Sham  
referendums  are also true.  Russia  wants  war.  It's true.  But Russia  will not be able  to 
stop  the course  of history.  Mankind  and the international  law are stronger  than  one 
terrorist  state.  Russia  will be forced  to end this war.  The war it has started.  
 I rule out that the settlement  can happen  on a different  basis  than  the Ukrainian  
peace  formula.  The further  the Russian  terror  reaches,  the less likely  it is that anyone  
in the world  will agree  to sit at one table  with  them.  
 And if my words  will be followed  by new  Russian  missiles  and acts of terrorism  
it will only  prove  the weakness.  Russia’s weakness.  Its inability  to prevail  over  us, its 
inability  to prevail  over  the world.  
 It will only  prove  that 5 items  of the Ukrainian  peace  formula  must  be 
implemented  as soon  as possible.   
 We are ready  for peace.  But true,  honest  and fair peace.  That’s why the world  
is on our side.   
 And finally.   
 I want  to thank  one hundred  and one countries  that voted  for my video  address  
to take  place . It was a vote  not only  about  the format.  It was the vote about  principles.  
 Only  seven  countries  voted  against:  Belarus,  Cuba,  North  Korea,  Eritrea,  
Nicaragua,  Russia  and Syria.  
 Seven  who  are afraid  of the video  address.  Seven  who  respond  to principles  
with  a red button.  Only  seven.  
 One hundred  and one – and seven.  
 Friends!  – if this coalition  is against  our determination,  then  I congratulate  you 
all. Because  this means  that peace  will prevail  over  any aggression,  and that there  is 
no Obstacle  for us to implement  the peace  formula.  
 I thank  you for your  attention!  
 Once  again,  I wish  you all peace!

 SRB_77_2022,"  Elements for a Statement by President of the Republic of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić at the General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  21 September 2022, New York Main theme: „A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges“  Esteemed President of the General Assembly,  Distinguished Secretary-General, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen,  It gives me a great honor to address you on behalf of the Republic of Serbia. Due to limited time, please do not mind if I skip the burden of formality, courtesy words, greetings of those who are present in this room or absent, and instead speak directly about the essence of what we gathered here.   I’ve been so many times in these premises. The seriousness of the present moment obliges me to share difficult, but true words with you. Everything we are doing here today seems impotent and vague. Our words make hollow and empty echo compering to the reality we are facing. And that reality is such that no one is listening to anyone here , no one strives towards real agreements and to resolving problems, and almost everyone takes care only of their own interests, breaching often along the way the basic principles of international law; throwing away the UN Charter and other documents this Organization is founded on.  It is neither fault of Antonio Guterres nor of anyone from UN, but of those powers who take care of nothing else but of meeting their own political, economic and unfortunately military goals.   We are witnesses that the age we live in is featured by complexity of global geopolitical situation. Our General Debate is being held in terms of undermined world peace, to the extent that has not been seen ever since the World War II and since the time the United Nations had been founded. Global challenges we are facing are threatening to radically change international security architecture and jeopardize established international legal order. Such complex times demand a lot of wisdom and unity, in order to preserve peace as the absolutely most important heritage woven into the foundations of the United Nations Organization. That is why I would like to speak clearly and accurately before you about five key challenges we are facing today: Point 1: Returning to peace and preservation of global stability; Point 2: Preservation of territorial integrity and sovereignty of internationally recognized states, members of this Organization, as a key principle of international public law and relations between the countries; Point 3: Energy security in terms of global crisis; Point 4: Financial safety of the poor and developing countries; Point 5: Food supply in terms of global supply chains interrupted by war.  Current global developments remind as more and more often that the principle of peaceful resolution of disputes has no alternative. This principle is outstanding today more than ever before and it is best described in the UN Charter Preamble which reads as follows – “to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors”. Denial of use of force and peaceful resolution of disputes are the pillars pf world stability; but they must ne accompanied by principles such as non-selective  observance of the UN Charter, implementation of mandatory UN Security Council Resolutions and basic principles of the applicable international public law.   Point 2: Preservation of territorial integrity and sovereignty of internationally recognized states, members of this Organization; Serbia supports territorial integrity of all UN member states, including also territorial integrity of Ukraine. In such a way, we behaved responsibly and seriously in this renowned institution. Nevertheless, we could hear from many speakers the stories about aggression and violation of territorial integrity of Ukraine. Many say that this was the first conflict on the European soil after the World War II. But, the truth that the territorial integrity of a country in Europe- Serbia as a matter of fact, which did not attack any other sovereign country, was violated is constantly unspoken. We ask for a clear answer to the question I’ve been asking my interlocutors, leaders of many countries for years – what is the difference between the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and sovereignty and territorial integrity of Serbia, which was grossly violated, and for which you provided international recognition and legitimacy? Nobody has ever provided a rational answer to that question.   Let me remind you – Serbia has not stepped its foot on someone else’s territory, nor has it endangered territorial integrity of a single sovereign state, so that anyone might intervene or carry out aggression against it, the way it was done in 1999. Nevertheless, it did not prevent NATO from attacking a sovereign country without the decision by the United Nations Security Council. Signing of the Agreement with NATO – upon termination of armed conflict – whose provisions envisaged adoption of the UN Security Council Resolution 1244, and which confirmed and guaranteed partial sovereignty and full territorial integrity of Serbia, did not prevent many western countries from unilateral recognition of independence of the so-called “Kosovo” and from violating, once again, territorial integrity of our country. Precisely for such developments that Serbia experienced and that is has been experiencing, I am convinced that I am fully entitled to quote, in this place, the words of great Martin Luther King: “Injustice anywhere is threat to justice everywhere”. These words are carved like a reminder, but as a warning to all of us.   Regardless of the fact that we still feel the consequences of the gross violation of basic provisions of international public law, we do not give up on United Nations foundation principles. We shall keep advocating consistent observance of the principle of inviolability of borders, respect for sovereignty and integrity of all other UN member states. Despite such position of ours, many in this room have issues with respecting territorial integrity of Serbia. You wonder why? Because they have the power is in their hands, and in their eyes, we are small and weak. However, as you could hear, we do have the strength to tell the truth here.   Your Excellencies,  We owe special gratitude to all those UN member states – and they currently constitute majority at this Assembly, who support territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia, particularly in the space and territory of Kosovo and Metohija. It is additionally encouraging that number of countries who support Serbia’s position increased in period between two sessions, which is a trend that must continue, because it is of utmost importance to remain loyal to basic principles woven into the UN Charter, such as the principle of inviolability of borders.  The Republic of Serbia, and I as its President, search very patiently and with a lot of good will for compromise regarding Kosovo and Metohija under the auspices of the European Union, and within Belgrade-Pristina dialogue. It is a difficult process, it has been lasting for more than ten years, but we see no alternative to it. It is better to negotiate for hundred years, than to wage war for a single day. I hope that we will reach mutually acceptable solution, based on compromise, because this is the absolutely only way for reaching our goal, which is a long-lasting peace, as a  prerequisite of prosperous life for Serbs and Albanians in our region. We have exhausted all other options and, and speaking for Serbia, at least, we do not even dream about going back to the paths of conflicts and bloodsheds. The Balkan region could not stand another conflict. I rely on good will and understanding from our international partners, because they know well that some earlier decisions by their governments had been bad and that they had not been acting in favor of the future of our region and world peace. Belgrade is running this process under very complex circumstances with elements of hybrid war and dirty campaign in part of international community against our country, in different fields. It would be enough just to remind you of the quotes and allegations of world media that Serbia would attack its neighbors and that Serbia was a threat to regional stability. Of course, it has never happened. And it was only one among numerous lies against the Republic of Serbia. Serbia was featured as a potential destabilizing factor in the region, only to be prevented from telling the truth- that the principle of inviolability of borders must be equally applicable to all.  Serbia was and it will be a factor of stability in the entire region. Serbia, despite many untruths and forgeries supports Dayton Peace Accords, territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and integrity of Republika Srpska within Bosnia and Herzegovina.  On the other hand, we are convinced that the nations of the Balkans do have the capacity to continue their lives in the future as friends and partners with common vision of membership to the united Europe. I know this well, because we have already surpassed many barriers that had been standing between our nations for years and that had costed us thousands of lives and wasted future. Serbia and Albania, for example, today have the closest and the friendliest relationship in the entire several centuries long common history in the space of the Balkan Peninsula.   It took only clear-headed and pragmatic discussions about our future, not about our past. To talk about how to resolve problems that were bothering our people, our  companies, workers, students and entrepreneurs. We had discussed a lot and reached, by ourselves, numerous solutions that have already cancelled barriers that existed between us for no rational reasons. First of all, in economy, trade and flow of people and capital. Serbia, Albania and North Macedonia have been implementing for three years “Open Balkan” Initiative, which has a clear vision - to open the region for the people, goods, services, capital and companies, in order to create the space which would be permanently liberated from tensions and conflicts. In addition to unquestionable common economic benefit that this Initiative brings, it has a broader dimension, first of all in connecting people with different cultures and in promoting diversity, which, by all means, contributes to general development of society in this part of Europe. In this way, Serbia, actually continues contributing to peace, stability and reconciliation process in the region, whereby it certainly gives significant contribution to global security.   We found the inspiration for the respective in words of one of the greatest diplomats in history and a great UN Secretary General Dag Hammerstad that this Organization “wasn’t created to take mankind into paradise, but rather, to save humanity from hell”.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  The moment we curbed the global pandemic, we have already faced new, unprecedented challenges for this century. While we, as a mankind, take one step at a time in accelerated technological development, there are existential problems ahead of us such as energy security, financial safety of the developing countries, but also distortions in the supply chains of the basic food provisions. Solidarity which had been necessary in fighting pandemic is needed to a far greater extent today, when people’s basic necessities for food and energy are endangered.  The Republic of Serbia thinks of its energy security as of the inseparable part of the national security and as the key prerequisite for the continuation of economic development and progress of our country. We strive to provide the continuity of energy supply, but we share the concern for current geopolitical challenges that undermine the energy stability in the word and Europe. We remain committed to finding solutions that might have the transformational strength in attempts to reach regional and European energy safety. I would like to underline that the Republic of Serbia managed to preserve continuity in energy supply during the ongoing crisis. Nevertheless, we remain vitally interested in diversifying supply sources, in additional investment in energy infrastructure, but also in faster and more efficient development of capacities based on renewables.   It is precisely at the United Nations where we named the ongoing decade the “decade of more sustainable and resilient future, action and transformation.” It has to remain like that, but at a bit faster pace! Unequal development, but also financial perils in the developing countries, cause additional social layering and inevitably brig new antagonisms. Equal development must neither be limited not conditioned either geographically or politically, but it must be provided to all people regardless of ethnical, racial, cultural and religious affiliation.   There is another, very important challenge ahead, which we must overcome together, and it is finding the most efficient way to avoid consequences of the current international crisis inflicted on global food supply security. Developments are highly alarming, and the reality is such that all of us, with no exceptions, are struck by them. Food supply security could be endangered in our part of Europe, and situation on continents, such as African one, threatens to be devastating. Growing prices of food and its availability have become an additional problem. Task for all of us is to find operational and efficient solutions that will leave no one behind. It is up to us- states-  as the most important internati0nal subjects, to involve individually in coordination of measures, first of all by contributing to this noble task at national levels, in order to preserve the most valuable things- human lives and their dignity.   The topic of this year’s General Debate warns us to the preciousness of a moment and relatedness of international challenges. Crises we are facing remind us of the importance of open communication. It does not take much wisdom to conclude that challenges can be successfully overpowered only if their causes are properly observed. We are witnessing that any problem ignoring and lack of communication between the countries makes the situation only more complex. Serbia believes that it is imperative that current challenges must not deepen world divisions in any way, and that already obvious and intentional polarization at global level should make room to principles of multilateralism   I would like to underline that the Republic of Serbia take part in collective efforts for reaching sustainable development goals and implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Serbia shares Secretary General’s vision in future of global cooperation I a way envisaged by “Our Common Agenda” and it strongly supports inclusive, networked and efficient multilateralism as the best tool for responding to the most urgent challenges for the mankind.   Ladies and Gentlemen, Multilateralism, collective actions and common responsibility are irreplaceable elements of our discussions so far, but allow me to underline that starting point for each such constructive engagement is solidarity.  Finally, I would like to reiterate that the Republic of Serbia will continue being a reliable partner in achieving common goals defined within the UN framework, firmly believing that it is the best path to create world for us and generations to come. But we must not forget that the United Nations are as strong as we respect commonly harmonized decisions and documents of this Organizations.   Thank you for attention.", SRB,2022

His Excellency Charles A . Savarin , SAH, DAH,  
President of the Commonwealth of Dominica  
 
 
 
On the occasion of the 77th session of the United Nations General 
Assembly  
 
 
 
Theme:  “A Watershed Moment, Transformative Solutions to 
Interlocking Challenges ” 
 
 
 
 
September 2 1, 2022  
 
United Nations  Headquarters  
New York 
 Mr. President , 
Your Excellencies ,  
Heads of State and Heads of Government,  
Distinguished Delegates ,  
Ladies and Gentlemen ,  
 
Warmest greetings and a very pleasant good evening  to all. 
 
 
Mr. President , 
My delegation , and by extension, t he Government and 
People of the Commonwealth of Dominica , congratulate you 
on your election to the Presidency of the 77th Session of the 
United Nations General Assembly , and wish you every 
success during your tenure.  
 
We also express appreciation and gratitude to your 
predecessor , His Excellency  Abdulla Shahid , for the able 
manner with which he presided over the 7 6th Session. 
 Mr. President, permit me to express my deepest condolences 
to his Majesty King Charles III, to the Royal Family and to 
the Government and People of the United Kingdom on the 
passing of Her Majesty  Queen Elizabeth II.  
 
Her Majesty was a symbol of stability and continuity, not 
only to the United Kingdom but to the Commonwealth and 
the world at large.  
 
As we continue to morn her passing, I ex tend my very best 
wishes and that of the Government and people of the 
Commonwealth of Dominica for long life and good health to 
His Majesty King Charles III and continued  prosperity  and 
peace  to the People of the United Kingdom.  
 
 
 
Mr. President : 
 This 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly is 
being convened at a time when we are faced with 
innumerable  challenges  which have  both cur rent and long -
term implications.  
 
These include  climate change ; degradation of our ecosystem 
and loss of biodiversity ; poverty ; inequality  and the growing 
challenge of chronic non -communicable diseases .   
All of these have occupied the attention of the august body 
over the years, with only marginal progress in finding 
solutions for resolving these major challenges.   
 
Compounding these challenges are other emerging threats 
such as the impact of  the COVID -19 pandemic  and the 
unfolding war in Ukraine.   
  
Mr. President, 
 The invasion of one country by another must always be 
condemned , and Dominica has condemned the  invasion  of 
Ukraine without reservation .   
 
There  will always be difference s and conflicting interest s 
between countries , but there must be a better way in this 
21st century , to avoid invasion and war as a mechanism for 
resolving  differences  or conflict s.   
 
In this in terconnected world, what happens in one part of 
the world affects us all and so it is with the war in Ukraine.   
 
We are all victims of the skyrocketing prices of oil and 
petroleum products and the resultant impact on the cost of 
electricity and on all aspects  of transportation.   
 
The cost of production of goods and services is similarly 
adversely affected and as Russia and Ukraine are among the 
 leading suppliers of grain, this conflict has created a 
shortage in the world’s supply of grain with implications for 
hunger in countries which rely on imports of grain from 
these two countries.  
 
Mr. President,  Excellencies,   
The developments since 2014 which have led to the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine in 2021 are well known.  Nevertheless, 
we in Dominica  are of the view that this invasion and the 
ensuing war could have been avoided.   
 
We hold firmly to the principle that international disputes 
should preferably be settled through negotiation and 
arbitration and not through war.   
 
We hold, Mr. President,  that might is not necessarily right.   
Whatever argument may be put forward, the terrible toll 
 being inflicted on the people of Ukraine in terms of loss of 
life and destruction of their towns and cities is unacceptable.  
 
The Commonwealth of Dominica therefore stands with the 
rest of the world in calling for an immediate  cessation to the 
conflict which continues to rage in Ukraine.  
 
 
 
Mr. President,  
The Commonwealth of Dominica welcomes the deal which  
was brokered between Ukraine and Russia, with the 
assistance of Turkey, ably supported by the UN Secretary 
General, to have significant quantities of grain shipped from 
Ukrainian ports to various destinations and thereby alleviate 
the emerging global food crisi s. 
 For these reasons and in the interest of  global peace, the 
Commonwealth of Dominica urges all parties , to continue 
upholding their end of this agreement so that further relief 
can be felt globally  as a result . We urge the United Nations  
(UN) to continue its efforts to broaden this opening  and 
thereby usher in wider agreement between the parties and 
to bring this war to an end.   
 
The COVID -19 Pandemic  
Mr. President,  
Like most Member States, we in Dominica and the 
Caribbean, were ill prepared to deal with COVID -19 which 
in March of 2020 was  declared a pandemic by the World 
Health Organization.  
 
Notwithstanding the fact that most countries managed to 
contain the Covid -19 pandemic and consequently  have eased 
COVID -19 restrictions,  public health experts have warned 
 that the pandemic is not yet over.  Furthermore, with new 
variants continuing to emerge, COVID -19 continues to pose 
a threat to the global community.   
 
This pandemic has exposed the limitations of health systems 
in all cou ntries large or small, developed and under -
developed. T he reality is that not all people have equal  access 
to vaccines and lifesaving medicines even when faced with a 
pandemic declared by the World Health Organization.   
 
We are now challenged to create better and stronger 
mechanisms, to allow a more effective  response to future 
pandemics , and bring certainty  for the poorest in the world , 
thus ensuring them, that they too , can have access to 
vaccines and medicines to combat future pandemics.  
 
Mr. President, 
 This years’ theme: A Watershed Moment, Transformative 
Solutions to Interlocking Challenges’ , is analogous  to the 
approach and trajectory outlined by the United Nations 
towards the attainment of the S ustainable Development 
Goals  (SDGs). Member States have individually embraced 
the SDGs as the ideal  to be universally pursued and 
achieved by 2030.   
 
Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are more challenged 
than most to achieve th ese goals. The international 
community has pledged its support , however the question 
is, to what extent has tangible support been forthcoming ?   
 
That is the question which we  must ask ourselves.   We are 
at a watershed moment in more ways than one , and 
transformative solutions are necessary . 
 The challenge is to go beyond promises, commitment s and 
pledges , to effective delivery and implementation.  
 
Climate Change  
Mr. President, Excellencies,  
The various global crises  do not respect national borders . 
Our inte rconnected world means that no one is insulated or 
immune from developments which take place anywhere on 
this planet.   Today planet earth is under severe  threat and 
stress , and may very well become  uninhabitable , if we  
further delay decisive corrective action .    
 
We need to t alk less and start taking those concrete and 
sustainable actions needed in order to reduce carbon 
emissions  into the atmosphere.  
 
It is important to remind this assembly , that Dominica is but 
a small, vulnerable island  State , located within  the 
 Hurricane Belt  in the Caribbean.   Hurricanes are getting 
stronger, more frequent, and more devastating because of 
climate change.  Five (5) days ago on September 17, the fifth 
anniversary of Hurricane Maria, Dominica was impacted by 
the outer bands of Tropical Storm Fiona as it struct the 
island of Guadeloupe, just north of Dominica .    
 
In addition to tropical storms and hurricanes, we are facing 
the prospects of droughts, warming seas and rising sea 
levels, all of which will affect lives and livelihoods.  
 
For this very reason we continue to champion the call for  
collective global action , to build the resilience of our small 
island states to natural disasters which are triggered and 
exacerbated by our changing climate, and to protect the 
gains that small island states have been able to achiev e over 
the past two (2) decades.  We must lay a path  for 
development that is sustainable and people -focused. 
  
Over several years small States like ours have stood at this 
very podium, and at many other such podiums across the 
world, seeking to convince the developed world to change 
destructive practices that threaten our planet, and our very 
lives and livelihoods.    
Yet despite our best efforts not enough corrective action is 
being taken. Not enough support is being given to us to 
adapt and build resilience to the impacts of climate change 
that are already upon us.  
 
I will not stand here today to detail to you the  ways in which 
climate change is affecting us. These are well known. We see 
the news reports; the evidence is all around us.  
 
What we need from our developed partners in this UN family 
is a recognition and acceptance of responsibility, that 
 translates to a commitment to provide the funding that is 
required to enable our small states to become resilient.  
 
This must be readily accessible and available to all of us on 
grant and concessional terms, with the only criteria for 
access being our vulnerability to extreme weather events.  
Mr. President,   
We have spoken here before of the cataclysmic impact of 
succe ssive disasters on our country.  Tropical Storm Erika 
in 20 15 and Hurricane Maria in 2017 caused over 90% and 
226% loss of GDP, respectively , with lives lost, people 
displaced , and livelihoods shattered.   
 
These  experience s triggered our goal of becoming the first 
climate resilient nation  in the world , and has reali gned our 
focus to concentrate on adaptation efforts  and building 
back better  in every sector of the economy. 
 Our Small Island Developing States are disproportionately 
affected by the impacts of climate change, a phenomenon 
which will continue to escalate with every increment of 
global warming.  
 
Mr. President,  
As sea levels rise, some small island states will eventually  
disappear , while  others will experience coastal erosion which 
will ultimately destroy infrastructure, villages, towns and 
cities.  
 
The Commonwealth of Dominica  therefore reiterates its call 
to the international community to prioritize at COP27 the 
disbursement of climate financing to SIDS , to support our 
adaptation and resiliency efforts as we seek to minimize loss 
and damage from extreme climate e vents . 
 In th is way, actions will reflect more equitable and justice -
oriented responses towards fulfilling the goals and promises 
of sustainable development.  Furthermore,  the continuous 
call for h igher levels of commitment towards climate ju stice 
must be reflected in tangible and effective responses .  
 
Sustainable Development Goals:  
Mr. President,   
Two months ago, at this very headquarters, the 
Commonwealth of Dominica presented its first Voluntary 
National Review (VNR)  in keeping wi th our international 
obligation s and in the spirit of good global g overnance.  
 
Dominica reported on the tremendous prog ress 
accomplished both in terms of the advances made towards 
the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) , and our national agenda guided by the vision of 
becoming the world’s first climate resilient nation. 
  
As we continue to recover from the destructive weather 
events already mentioned, Dominic a’s main economic 
industries are showing signs of positive recovery.  
 
Tourism and agriculture remain  the main  income generating 
sectors with GDP projected to reach pre -pandemic level by 
2023 , averag ing 5% growth per year from 2022 to 2026. 
Tourism recovery has been supported by new infrastructure  
projects and improved and increased air access.  
 
Mr. President ,   
At the centre  of Dominica’s resilience agenda are our 
citizens. The Government of Dominica has taken bold steps 
to continue revolutionizing its health and housing sectors, 
utilizing funds generated from its Citizen ship By Investment 
(CBI) p rogramme. 
 Across  Dominica,  new and modern climate resilient home s 
are being constructed for low and middl e-income families, 
while modern and  smart health and wellness centres have 
been constructed  and equipped , in urban and rural 
communities .   
 
This will allow them  to withstand the impac t from extreme 
weather and remain operational while also strengthening 
response to other natural emergencies and pandemic s.  
 
Dominica therefore calls on all States to adopt a multilateral , 
transformative and resilient approach towar ds the 
achievement of  the Sustainable Development G oals, and to 
support each other to meet our collective SDG targets to 
2030.  
 
Mr. President, 
 In that regard, t he Commonwealth of Dominica takes this 
opportunity to commend  the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China for its commitment to add a further $42 
billion to the new Global Development and South -South 
Cooperation Fund .  
 
This will assist countries like Dominica that are on the 
frontline of the negative impact s of climate change, to  
accelerate the realization of the 2030 Agenda.  
 
Food Security:  
Mr. President,   
Ensuring our citizens enjoy long  and health y lives will 
always be a priority. Therefore, what we grow and consume 
has to be a critical component of our resilience agenda.  
Global trends indicate that issues surrounding food security 
are not unique to Dominica. 
 Indeed, SDG 2 – Zero Hunge r, calls on Governments to 
pursue smart and sustainable food production to help 
alleviate the perils of hunger.  
 
Dominica is working to strengthen its agriculture sector to 
reduce on the importation of its food import bill. There is 
renewed emphasis on growing what we eat, and eating what 
we grow  while at the same time ensuring that there is  
affordable and high quality produce for export on a 
consistent basis.     
  
Our aim is to develop a scientific and practical approach  to 
reducing the vulnerability of farmers and fisherfolk, through 
the adoption of resilient  and sustainable  practices . 
 
 
 
Global Security: 
 Mr. President,   
On May 25,  2022, the Commonwealth of Dominica signed 
the Comprehensive Nuclear Test -Ban Treaty, and 
subsequently ratified the said Treaty in June 2022.  
Dominica , and as far as we are aware, no Caribbean country 
has ever created, test ed or launched a nuclear weapon.    
 
We embraced this signing as our international obligation 
towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons , as 
outlined in the UN Charter, for the maintenance of 
international peace and security.  
 
Dominica therefore calls on all S tates who have nuclear  
weapons , to abide by international law , for the non -
proliferation of nuclear weapon s and the use of diplomacy 
as a tool towards conflict resolution.  
 
Cuba 
 Mr. President,   
The trade and economic embargo imposed against our 
brothers and sisters in Cuba continues to be of great 
concern to us in the Caribbean , and the lifting  of it, has 
become more urgent in light of the global impact of the 
Russia -Ukraine war on food security .   
 
The Commonwealth of Dominica continues to j oin its voice 
with the voices of the overwhelming majority of  members of 
this global organization , to call for the immediate lifting  of 
the unjustified trade restrictions and export bans  imposed 
on the good people of Cuba.  
 
It has long been established , that whatever the objectives 
were 60 years ago  when  this embargo was instituted, it can 
no longer  be justified , if it ever was . 
 The G overnment of Dominica therefore  strongly urges the 
few States  who continue to support these sanctions , to heed 
the call of the overwhelming majority of us gathered here, 
and lift this archaic, and unfair  embargo against Cuba and 
let us all support the full integration of the Cuban people 
into the global fi nancial and trading systems.   
 
The embargo  notwithstanding, the Cuban people continue 
to make a tremendous contribution to human capital 
development  across the globe.  
 
For decades, Cuba has been training medical doctors, 
nurses, engineers, and other professionals , as well as  
providing technical assistance to developing countries as 
part of its South -South cooperation. Cuba also offers 
professional training in various disciplines to thousands of 
students from all over the developing world.  
Additionall y, Cuba continues to add its voice in the fight 
 against terrorism and drug trafficking in the Caribbean and 
the rest of the world.  
 
We therefore  join all other member states who have called 
for the removal of Cuba from the list of countries that 
sponsor terrorism , and we ask instead , that we redirect our 
efforts  to combating the real threats to global peace and 
security  in the region .  
 
Venezuela  
Mr. President,   
In March of 2015 the United States declared Venezuela as 
posing an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States and imposed 
sanctions on that country.   
 
The United States has been followed by a number of  
countries in imposing sanctions , and since  then t he good 
 people of Venezuela have been enduring severe hardship and 
suffering from the imposition of numerous financial and 
economic sanctions.  
 
The consequences of these sanctions prevent millions of 
Venez uelans from meeting their most basic needs, made 
even worse by the COVID -19 pandemic and the war in 
Ukraine , further impacting Venezuela’s contracted economy 
and an already weakened health system.   
 
The Commonwealth of Dominica again joins with the voices  
of the many other members of this global organization, to 
call for the immediate lifting of the unjustified oil embargo 
and other general sanctions imposed on the people of 
Venezuela.   
Despite the implementation of those heavy and unjustified 
sanctions, V enezuela continues to provide meaningful 
technical and financial assistance to it regional p artners. 
 This is quite evident  through the benefits being derived from 
the Petrocaribe Energy Security Agreement through the 
ALBA Caribe Fund.  
 
The political, economic, social and humanitarian crises in 
Venezuela demand immediate attention. It is further 
incumbent upon all of us  to provide short and long -term 
solutions and opportunities for Venezuela  to resolve its 
challenges  and quickly improve the lives of ordinary 
Venezuelans.  
 
 
 
 
Haiti  
Mr. President,  
The current situation  in Haiti continues to be of great 
concern to us in the Caribbean and demands greater 
 international attention.   An editorial in the Washington post 
of 6th August 2022 called for “ Muscular International 
intervention.”   This was followed on  8th August 2022  by a 
statement from the Secretary  General  of the Organization of 
American States (OAS), reproaching the international 
community for its failure over the years in assisting Haiti 
and leaving the country in chaos.  
 
Mr. President , 
Haiti is a country which was once the wealthiest colony in 
the Americas.  It is now the poorest  country in the Western 
Hemisphere .  The magnitude 7.0 earthquake of 2010 left  the 
country totally devastated.  It claimed  some 250,000 lives, 
over 300,000 injured and laid waste the capital Port Au 
Prince and most of southern Haiti.   
 
It had an estimated cost of over US$ 8 billion in damage and 
a reconstruction cost of approximately US$14  billion. 
 Currently, some 1.3 million people are said, by United 
Nations (UN) agencies, to be suffering from food insecurity, 
and 4.6 million from limited access to basic food supplies.  
 
While I am pleased to acknowledge the recent meeting of 
Lead Heads o f Government of CARICOM that took place in 
Trinidad and Tobago, to specifically find solutions to the 
many crises which beset Haiti, the international community 
needs to respond as if Haiti was under invasion , as is the 
case with Ukraine; or as it did in a post war reconstruction 
situation as was the case with Europe after World War II , 
requiring a  so called Marshal Plan. Nothing less can 
overcome the deep -rooted reconstruction challenges facing 
Haiti.  
 
We therefore urge this UN family to forge an effectiv e, unified 
response that brings to bear the necessary resources 
 financial, technical and otherwise, to alleviate the suffering 
of the Haitian people.  
 
Mr. President,   
The sever e and voluminous impacts of the various 
challenges that we have been experienci ng in recent times , 
highlights the importance of multilater alism.  
 
As we raise the various issues confronting our individual 
states, and share our hopes, fears and expectations, let us 
seek also to offer solutions to our various problems as a 
united international community  eager to realize a 
sustainable, transformative an d fairer future for all.   
 
As I conclude, allow me to  reiterate my country’s gratitude , 
to all of our international partners and friendly Governments 
who have stood with the Commonwealth of Dominica, 
particularly through our darkest days. 
  
Our journey is one of ‘building back better ,’ sustainability  
and resilience , and with your continued support we look 
forward to b righter  days ahead.  
 
Mr. President , 
I wish you and all delegates to this 77th Session every 
success in their deliberations.  
 I Thank you .", DMA,2022

www.mzv.cz/un.newyorkMr President,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
This United Nations , its principles, which we established after the Second World 
War, is in grave danger . 
One of the presumed gatekeepers  of the UN Charter, one of the Permanent 
Members of the UN Security Council, Russia, is attacking a sovereign neighbouring 
democracy and wreaking havoc in Eastern Europe and the entire world.  
If we continue to allow a new colonial war, then why are we here ? Why do we keep 
this United Nations alive? Do we care or are we indifferent?  
Czech government’s foreign policy is guided by the legacy of our former President 
Václav Havel. A  globally respected human rights defender and a renowned politician, 
who once sai d: 
“Our indifference towards others can after all result in only one thing: the 
indifference  of others towards us. ” 
The fact that representatives of all UN member states are meeting here to address 
major global challenges manifests that we are not indiffer ent to the suffering of 
others.  
It shows that we care.   
The circumstances have changed dramatically since our last meeting though.  
The Russian invasion  in Ukraine has fundamentally shaken the international order. 
On February 24, not only Europe but the whole world entered a new era.  
Russia tries to dismantle the security architecture of the European continent, 
launching a colonial war of conquest. Ironic ally, President Putin declares partial 
mobilization and threatens the world with use of nuclear weapons today, on the UN 
International Day of Peace. What more proof do we need? This is our new terrifying  
reality .  
Russia’s unjustifiable, unprovoked and ill egal war of aggression against Ukraine does 
not only blatantly violate the UN Charter. It badly damages global economy and 
food security  of many countries gathered in this hall. It seriously threatens the rules -
based international order. It harms all UN me mber states.  
I am shocked to the core listening to the Russian state controlled TV channels 
preaching the strategy of hunger and cold  towards Ukraine and the world. 
Approving the torture and mass killings of civilians with the argument that the world 
has t o fear Russia.Russia must immediately cease  its military actions and withdraw all its troops from 
the entire territory of Ukraine. Russia’s complete disregard  for the resolutions 
adopted by the UN General Assembly is appalling.  
Czechia resolutely supports  Ukraine’s right  to defend its territorial integrity and 
population in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.  
Czechia fully supports sovereignty, unity and independence  of Ukraine within its 
internationally recognized borders. We will never recogniz e the illegal annexation  
of Crimea. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the upcoming sham 
referenda  in parts of the Ukrainian territory.  
We resolutely reject any attempts to create s pheres of influence instead of 
equal partnerships. The time of establishing colonies  and acquiring territories by 
sheer force of arms is over!   
Today, it is Ukraine. Tomorrow, it could be any of us.  
We refuse this world of Russian colonial appetite.  
We are horrified by the atrocities  committed by the Russian invader. We condemn 
the existence of “filtration” camps run by Russia and the horrors in Mariupol, Bucha, 
Irpin, Izyum and many other places in Ukraine as well as the apocalyptic shelling of 
civilian infrastructure.  
Hundre ds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens  were deported to Russia, including 
children . Children forcibly taken away from their parents! It reminds us of the worst 
practices of the Soviet Union and nazi Germany in the first half of the 20th century.  
All these r eports on Russian military conduct must be independently 
investigated . Russia must respect its obligations under the international 
humanitarian law.  
There is Russia’s international responsibility for the aggression, but there is 
also an  individual crimina l responsibility – for the crimes committed on such a large 
scale by Russian troops. We will hold all war criminals accountable.  
Czechia supported the referral to the ICC Prosecutor  to open an investigation of the 
situation on the ground in Ukraine.   
We a lso strongly support Ukraine’s Application instituting the proceedings against the 
Russian Federation under the Genocide Convention before the International Court 
of Justice .  
And, we call for establishment of a special international tribunal  that will 
prosecute the crime of aggression committed by Putin’s Russia.   
Apart from that, we support Ukraine comprehensively. Czechia hosts the highest 
number of Ukrainian refugees per capita  - over 400 thousand. We provide 
volumes of humanitarian aid. We support sta bilization, recovery and reconstruction 
efforts of the Ukrainian government. Not only with words, but with action.Mr. President,  
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has only strengthened my country’s resolve to 
continue supporting independent media, civil  society and human rights 
defenders.   
Inside Russia, unfortunately, t he human rights situation of any freedom -loving citizens 
has worsened enormously.  
We successfully ran for the  Human Rights Council  seat vacated by Russia in May. I 
would like to thank for the broad support, which we received from many of you.  
We warmly welcome the appointment of Mr. Volker Türk as the new High 
Commissioner for Human Rights.   I wish to thank the former High Commission er 
Michelle Bachelet for her dedicated work during her term in office.   
The latest report on China documented by her Office shed light on the alarming human 
rights violations against Muslim groups, including Uyghurs . 
Unfortunately, the human rights situat ions in countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, 
Ethiopia, Iran, Myanmar or Venezuela  also continue to worsen.  
We wish for Myanmar  to work towards a peaceful resolution of the current crisis.   
We follow with horror the atrocious manner in which the Iranian  authorities handle 
the rightful protests of women.  
In Belarus , the regime uses brutal violence against its opponents. In the past two 
years, tens of thousands of Belarussians have been detaine d, all independent media 
and civil society organizations destroyed.   
We are concerned that antisemitism and the Holocaust denial  are on the rise. 
This year marks 80 years since the infamous “Wannsee Conference” with the so -called 
“Final Solution to the Je wish Question”, which resulted in the murder of nearly 6 
million Jews.   
Czechia reiterates Israel’s right to protect its citizens  against any terrorist 
activities, including rocket attacks, which deliberately target Israeli civilians.   
Mr. President,  
Czechia currently holds the Presidency of the European Union . Our priorities, 
such as defending Ukraine, ensuring energy security, and promoting democracy and 
human rights are not only regional. They are global in nature.  
The Russian aggression has only multi plied the already existing global challenges . 
The progress on the  Sustainable Development Goals  and the global recovery 
from the Covid -19 pandemic has slowed down. Prices of agriculture 
commodities  are growing globally.  
For us, working with youth , listening to their concerns, is the driving force to get the 
progress on SDGs back on track.Climate change, pollution and biodiversity  loss  are major global challenges. We 
need a comprehensive humanitarian -development -peace b ased response  to 
crises, including pandemics, and sustainable food systems and climate resilience.  
It is our collective responsibility to ensure that WHO  can work effectively and 
independently of any political influence. N o one should be left behind. We f irmly 
support the global efforts for equal access to vaccines and treatment . 
Stakes are high as the next UN Climate Conference COP27  in Egypt is 
approaching.    
It has been said many times before, but I will reiterate once again: If we do not act 
now, it m ight soon be too late!  
The development of relations between the EU and Africa  is among the priorities of 
the Czech EU Presidency. Africa is facing food shortages and negative impacts of 
climate change and the COVID -19 pandemic. Russian aggression against U kraine has 
blocked exports  of agricultural products .   
I cannot but express my outrage at how  Russian disinformation 
propaganda  is trying to use the food crisis in Africa to spread false narratives that the 
EU sanctions against Russia caused the shortage. Obviously, if Russia had not 
invaded Ukraine, we would not have had to deal with this issue at all!   
Mr. President,  
Turning to other security issues, we are concerned about the increased tensions in 
the Taiwan Strait  caused by unilateral threatening actions. We expect cross -strait 
differences to be resolved by peaceful means, while the status quo is being maintained.  
The digital s pace  carries many opportunities but there are risks entailed, too: cyber -
attacks and cybercrime, misuse of technology and, in particular, disinformation.  
Let me say this loud and clear – a lie is not an opinion . For far too long, we have 
overlooked the spr ead of disinformation  directed against our common values.   
Let us not forget the Covid -related disinformation . We had to learn the hard way 
when disinformation began to cost human lives.  
This is why we need to make sure our citizens and societies are resi lient , and 
independent media operate freely. We will continue to reach out and help countries 
exposed to lies and propaganda.  
Czechia promotes the concept of “ digital humanism ” which keeps human interests 
and needs at the center of emerging technologies.  
Instances of internet shutdowns are growing. We must maintain a free, open, safe, 
secure, and stable cyberspace  where human rights apply online as they do offline.   
The number of cyber -attacks , including state -sponsored ones, continues to rise, as 
does the ir severity. New potential of terrorist threat has appeared with the escalation 
of Russia’s aggressive policies.Terrorism  maliciously feeds on weak governance, economic hardship and social 
injustice, with the Sahel region being struck the most.   
Czechia  reiterates its commitment to countering terrorism and supporting 
countries  that suffer from terrorist violence or threat.   
I would like to use this opportunity to remind Russia  that Czechia still awaits its 
official response concerning the explosion in t he ammunition depot in my 
country  in 2014. This completely appalling act was planned and executed by agents 
of the Russian military intelligence GRU and claimed the lives of two innocent Czech 
citizens, in addition to material damage. Such conduct is a cle ar violation of 
international law.  
Mr President,  
Non-proliferation  of nuclear weapons is also negatively impacted  by Russia’s 
aggression against Ukraine. Russia does not hesitate to use dangerous nuclear rhetoric, 
which became a new standard of terrorizing peaceful populations.  
Czechia resolutely decries Russia’s occupation of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear 
Power Plant . An y armed attack on nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes 
constitutes a violation of the UN Charter and the Statute of the IAEA.   
We regret that despite lengthy negotiations, it was not possible to achieve consensus 
on a final outcome document of the 10th NPT Review Conference  because Russia 
opposed.  
And, we call on Iran  to act urgently to fulfil its legal obligations under its NPT 
Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and clarify all outstanding issues. We 
commend the IAEA and its Director General fo r their professional work in verifying 
Iran's safeguards obligations.  
Mr President,  
This United Nations, this universal organization, has a duty  to help us better 
react to existing and emerging global challenges. But, in these dark and stormy times, 
it has  the duty to firmly defend the principles it was founded on, the UN Charter, 
human rights and rules -based international order.  
I thank you.", CZE,2022
 CUB_77_2022,"Statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic 
of Cuba, H.E. Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, at the Ministerial 
Meeting of the Coordinating Bureau of the Movement of Non-
Aligned Countries.  
New York, September 21, 2022  
 
Theme: “The role of the Movement of Non -Aligned Countries 
in the global post- pandemic recovery:   the way forward.”  
 
His Excellency Mr. Jeyhun Bayramov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan;  
Distinguished Ministers and Heads of Delegations;  
Esteemed partic ipants;  
For six decades now, the Movement of Non- Aligned Countries has struggled in defense of our 
just vindications and the legitimate rights of our peoples.  
We are 120 countries from five continents, a heterogeneous mixture of ideologies, religions, 
cultures, development levels and historical experiences.   Our diversity, far from being a 
weakness, is one of our strengths.   
We represent the absolute majority and almost two thirds of the total number of member countries of the United Nations. We need to act  with unity, cohesion, creativity and solidarity in 
the defense of our collective interests.  
It is imperative that consensus is respected for decision- making within the Movement, as it was 
established in the Cartagena Document on Methodology and ratified l ater on in Havana by our 
Heads of State and Government.  
Consensus has been and still is crucial to maintain solidarity and unity among Non- Aligned 
Countries.   In our Movement, consensus is a synonym of substantial agreement and entails a 
broad, participatory and transparent process of consultations necessary to achieve it, but it does 
not require or involve unanimity.  
The negative trend of quantifying whatever consensus means should be overcome as soon as 
possible.   Granting only three delegations the facul ty of vetoing the agreement reached by the 
other 117 is a harmful practice that not only contravenes the provisions adopted at Cartagena and Havana, but also negatively affects our capacity for concerted political action.  
Sometimes, the search for unanimit y has led us to a paralysis, even in situations of flagrant 
violations of the Charter and International Law, which has an obvious cost for the credibility of our Movement.We should also move forward in the coordination of positions between the Non- Aligned 
Countries Movement and the G -77 plus China, in the context of the Joint Coordination 
Committee, which will convey a message on unity and solidarity from the South as well as 
greater strength to face common challenges as developing countries.  
Mr. President ; 
We are living through hard times.  
The COVID -19 pandemic exacerbated the serious problems facing humanity.  
It increased economic plundering by big transnationals, particularly in the pharmaceutical 
sector: It accentuated the asymmetries between developed and developing countries and made 
the current unequal international order to be even more unjust.  
The post -pandemic recovery period is portrayed as a term of big challenges but also of big 
opportunities for the Movement.   We should continue promoting initi atives that would follow up 
on the different steps already taken under the leadership of the Azerbaijani Presidency.  
Likewise, the Movement has the colossal   responsibility of heading, together with the G -77 plus 
China, the efforts of the countries of the South to move forward in the construction of a new 
international economic order that is more just, democratic and equitable and meets the 
legitimate developmental aspirations of our peoples.  
In the face of the hegemonic attempts that undermine multilateral ism and seek to destroy and 
weaken us, the NAM should strengthen as a diverse, inclusive and representative forum.  
Mr. President;  
The enormous damage caused by the tightened economic, commercial and financial blockade 
against Cuba, will not undermine our f raternal and humanist vocation.  
Cuba will continue to make its modest contribution to whoever may need it, particularly the 
countries that are members of the Movement. We do it based on our firm commitment with the founding principles of Bandung;agreed in Havana and the strong belief that solidarity is not an 
option, but a necessity.  
Mr. President;  
I will conclude by conveying our profound appreciation for the historical position adopted by 
NAM to firmly reject the criminal and illegal US blockade against C uba. 
We are convinced that, once again, we will receive the valuable support of its member States when the United Nations General Assembly considers this item on November 2 and 3 this year 
and takes action, for the thirtieth time, regarding the draft resol ution calling for an end to this 
policy.  
The Movement of Non- Aligned Countries will always be able to count on Cuba, just as we count 
on its solidarity and support.  
Thank you, very much.

STATEMENT  BY DR GNM  PANDOR,  MINISTER  OF INTERNATIONAL  
RELATIONS  AND  COOPERATION  ON THE OCCASION  OF THE 
GENERAL  DEBATE  OF THE  77TH SESSION  OF THE UNITED  
NATIONS  GENERAL  ASSEMBLY  
 
21 SEPTEMBER  2022  
UNITED  NATIONS,  NEW  YORK  
 
President  of the 77th Session  of the UN General  Assembly,  His 
Excellency  Mr Csaba  Kőrösi,  
Secretary -General,  His Excellency  Mr António  Guterres,  
Excellencies  Heads  of State  and Government,  
Ladies  and Gentlemen,  
 
We meet  at a time when  the UN family  is facing  its greatest  tests . Member  
states  have  to work  with the United  Nations  to develop  effective  responses  
to the current  challenges.  As the theme  of the general  assembly  indicates  
these  are diverse , immense , yet interconnected  challenges  and no 
country  can respond  alone.  Some  have referred  to this moment  as a key 
turning  point  in history.  The COVID -19 pandemic  and the war in Eastern  
Europe  shape  our attitudes  today,  however  for South  Africa  the real 
inflection  point  will be the world  attending  fully to the needs  of the 
marginalise d and forgotten.  Our greatest  global  challenges  are poverty  
inequality  joblessness  and feeling  excluded.  Acting  on the Common Agenda  vision  2021  of the UN Secretary  General  should  become  the 
major  objective  of this time because  addressing  poverty  and 
under development  will be the beginnings  of the real inflection  point  in 
human  history.    
 
The Charter  of the United  Nations,  the Universal  Declaration  for Human  
Rights  and its human  rights  protocols  all commit  us to  protecting   all 
people  without  distinction  of any kind.   We must  acknowledge  that we face 
theses  crises  today  because  we have  not always  upheld  these   
foundational  principles  consistently  and fairly.   
 
The COVID -19 pandemic  has provided us with a roadmap  on what  should  
be done  and not done   to addre ss global  challenges.  We should  use the 
lessons  learnt  effectively.  There  were  some  noble  initiatives  such  as the 
Access  to COVID -19 tools  Accelerator  (ACT -A) that was co-chaired  by 
President  Ramaphosa,  the  African  Union  Champion  for the COVID  
response,  and the Prime  Minister  of Norway.  This initiative  laid the basis  
for a fairer  distribution  of vaccines,  therapeutics  and diagnostics.   
Mr President,  global  solidarity  is also required  to meet  other  pressing  
challenges  such  as energy  and food insecurity,  climate  change  and the 
devastation  caused  by conflicts  including  the existential  threat  of nuclear  
weapons.   
 
Instead  of working  collectively  to address  these  challenges,  we have  
grown  further  apart  as geopolitical  tensions  and mistrust  permeate  our 
relations .  We should,  however,  move  forward  in solidarity  united  in efforts  
to address  our common  global  challenges  to ensure  sustainable  peace  
and development. Mr President,   
 
One of the tasks  we must  successfully  implement  to ensure  developing  
countries  are  not left behind  when  treatments  are available  is to create  
and support   research  and innovation  capacity  in Africa  for vaccine  
production  invest  in strengthened  public  health  systems  and produce  
thousands  more  professional  health  workers.   This requires  sustainable  
investment  in higher  education  research  institutions  and in global  
research  cooperation . 
 
The mobilisation  of resources  and capabilities  to strengthen  the pandemic  
response  and preparedness  of all nations  must  be substantially  
increased.  It will be a tragic  indictment  on all of us as leaders  if future  
pandemics  found  the poorest  as unprepared  as many   were  for COVID -
19. 
 
We need  to strengthen  the global  health  architecture  to ensure  that we 
are better  able  to meet  the challenges  of new pandemics  and other  
diseases  of concern.   South  Africa  is proud  to be part of this solution  
through  the establishment  of the first mRNA  global  technology  transfer  
hubs  that will contribute  to the security  of supply  of life-saving  medication  
for African  countries  and other developing  countries.   
 
Mr President,   
 
South  Africa,  like many  other  developing  countries,  faces  huge  
developmental  challenges,  including  in our energy  sector.  We need  to 
collectively  address  global  energy  shortages,  including  by deploying  
innovative  solutions  that are cheaper,  cleaner  and more  accessible. Working  with international  partners  we are developing  our Just Energy  
Transition  Plan to significantly  reduce  harmful  emissions  in South Africa.  
Work  on an expanded  green  economy  is also  gaining  significant  
momentum.  
 
Mr President,  
 
We commend  the Secretary -General  for focussing  attention  on 
transforming  education.  Education  remains  one of the most  important  
drivers  to end poverty  and inequality  and we will work  towards  increasing  
the access  to education  that is affordable.  South  Africa has no fee schools  
at primary  and secondary  school  levels  for the most  vulnerable  learners.  
There  is also a state  bursary  for poor students  who  qualify  for tertiary  
education.  These  measures  have  over the years  served  to increase  the 
enrolment  of leane rs that were  previously  unable  to  access  education.    
 
In the field of research  and innovation,  we need  more  partnerships  such  
as the Square  Kilometre  Array  (SKA)science  infrastructure   project  hosted  
in South  Africa,  which  is an international  partnership  that is one of the 
largest  scientific  endeavours  in history.  Partnerships  of this nature  must  
be encouraged  to leverage  scientific  breakthroughs  for development  
purposes.   
 
Mr President,  
 
The multilateral  trading  system  must  be strengthened  so that we 
genuinely  create  a conducive  environment  for fair trade  that also provides  
opportunities  for developing  economies.  If actionable  steps  such  as these are not taken,  developing  countries  will remain  subject  to an imbalanced  
global  financial  and trading  system.   
 
Mr President,   
 
Using  this moment  of renewal,  we reiterate  our commitment  to 
multilateralism  as the only means  to build  a better  world.  The United  
Nations  itself must  be transformed  so that it serves  its role cognisant  of 
current  global  dynamics.  It is unacceptable  that 77 years  after its 
establishment,  five nations  wield  disproportionate  decision -making  power  
in the United  Nations  system  as a whole.  Transformation  must  include  
more  representative,  transparent  and accountable  organs  of global  
governan ce. For the UN to be effective,  the General  Assembly  must  be 
revitalised,  the Security  Council  must  be reformed.  We also cannot  have  
a credible  organisation  if persistent  transgressors  of the Charter  are not 
held accountable.   
 
Mr President,  
 
We must  act immediately  to protect  the environment  and the world  we live 
in, for ourselves  and for future  generations.   Africa  is the least  responsible  
for the climate  crisis,  and yet it  finds  itself at the epicentre  of its worst  
impacts.  We should  therefore  emerge  from COP27,  in Egypt,  with an 
agreement  that contains  enhanced  and balanced  actions  on adaptation,  
mitigation,  and financing.  This must  take into account  our common  but 
differentiated  responsibilities  and respective  capabilities.  In addition,  we 
must  agree  on a mechanism  for loss and damage. In South  Africa,  our Cabinet  has approved  wide-reaching  policies  to 
ensure  that we can meet  our climate  change  targets.   We have  
established  a Presidential  Climate  Finance  Task  Team  to lead and 
coordinate  negotiations  with the International  Partner  Group  to give effect  
to the Just Energy  Transition  Partnership  or JETP.  The JETP  seeks  to 
address  South  Africa’s  investment  needs  in infrastructure  to facilitate  our 
coal phase -down  in a manner  that ensures  that no one is left behind.  
 
Mr President,   
 
Building  a better  world  requires  peace  and stability.   South  Africa  
continues  to believe  that conflict  resolution  must  not come  through  fuelling  
conflicts,  but through   investing  in efforts  aimed  at political  dialogue.  We 
should  aspire  to peace  as a global  public  good.  There  have  been  no 
winners  of the wars  of  the past seven  decades.  Instead,  they engendered  
strife,  distrust  among  nations,  divisions,  a perpetual  misallocation  of 
resources  to weapons,  increased  poverty  and underdevelopment.  
 
While  we work  to address  contemporary  conflicts,  we should  not ignore  
long-standing  ones  such  as Palestine  that has been  on the United  
Nations’  agenda  throughout  the seven  decades  of existence  of the 
organisation.  We cannot  ignore  the words  of the former  Israeli  negotiat or 
at the Oslo talks,  Daniel  Levy,  who addressed  the UN Security  Council  
recently  and referred  to, “The increasingly  weighty,  body  of scholarly,  legal  
and public  opinion  that has designated  Israel  to be perpetrating  apartheid  
in the territories  under  its control.”  Israel  must  be held accountable  for its 
destructive  actions  that have  significantly  impaired  the possibility  of a two-
state  solution. Similarly,  we cannot  ignore  the decades -long struggle  for self-
determination  of the people  of Western  Sahara.  We must  treat all conflicts  
across  the globe  with equal  indignation,  no matter  what  the colour  or creed  
of the people  affected.   
 
South  Africa  calls for an end to the embargo  against  Cuba,  which  
continues  to impede  the right to development  of her people.  In the same  
vein,  we call for an end to unilateral  coercive  measures  against  
Zimbabwe,  which  have  compounded  the problems   experienced  by the 
people  of Zimbabwe  and have   a detrimental  effect  on the broader  
Southern  African  region.  
 
Mr President,  
 
Our ques t to build  a better  world  will remain  unfulfilled  as long as people  
are still discriminated  against  on the basis  of race,  gender,  sex, ethnic  or 
social  origin,  colour,  sexual  orientation,  age, disability,  religion,  
conscience,  belief,  culture,  or language.   
 
We have  a responsibility  to make  sure that every  girl child receives  an 
education  and that every  woman  has an opportunity  to work,  to study,  to 
start a business  and to have  choice  and control  over her life and body.    
 
We need  to end the violence  perpet rated  against  the most  vulnerable,  
most  often  women  and children.  We have  witnessed  that women  in 
conflict  situations  are particularly  vulnerable,  including  women  journalists.  
The killing  of Shireen  Abu Akleh,  and others  is a stark  reminder  of the 
dangers  that women  in conflict  situations  face.  We must  do all we can to 
protect  them,  and hold those  accountable  for harming  them.  
We must  also strengthen  the capacity  and draw  on the voices  of the youth  
on the African  continent.  In this regard,  we need  to harness the 
demographic  dividend  by maximising  our investment  in quality  education  
as a means  to address  intergenerational  poverty,  together  with inclusive  
economies.   
 
Mr President   
 
Home  to more  than 1.3 billion  people,  Africa  is fast emerging  from 
centuries  of colonialism,  occupation  and exploitation,  from wilful  neglect  
and under -development.   
 
Through  the African  Continental  Free Trade  Area,  the countries  of Africa  
are laying  a firm foundation  for a new era of trade,  commerce  and 
productivity.  
 
African  coun tries are establishing  the conditions  for the seamless  flow of 
goods  and services  between  African  markets,  for the growth  of industry  
and for the construction  of the roads,  bridges,  railway  lines,  ports  and 
power  stations  that will enable  growth.  
 
As we continue  our efforts  to end war, conflict  and insurgency  in several  
parts  of our continent  and to prevent  the unconstitutional  seizure  of power,  
we will continue  to seek  greater  alignment  between  the agendas  of the 
United  Nations  and the African  Union. 
 
Mr President, To overcome  all these  acutely  global  challenges,  we must  agree  to a 
common  path out of an increasingly  polarised  world.  A rules -based  
international  system,  predicated  on international  law and strict  adherence  
to the provisions  of the UN Charter,  is essential.  Such  a system  must  
safeguard  the interests  of all and not only the powerful  countries.  
 
We acknowledge  the efforts  of the Secretary -General  through  his vision  
contained  in the report  on ‘Our Common  Agenda’,  to provide  us with 
option s to be able to put aside  our differences,  build  trust and forge  a world  
where  future  generations  will prosper  and thrive.   
 
I thank  you.", ZAF,2022
 CRI_77_2022,"Discurso del Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de la República de Costa Rica, Dr. Arnoldo André -
Tinoco, durante  el debate de alto nivel de la septuagésima sétima Asamblea General de la s Naciones 
Unidas.  21 de setiembre, 2022, Nueva York  
Revisar contra alocución/Check against delivery  
Mr. President, 
Excellencies, 
Distinguished delegates, 
Costa Rica congratulates you on your election as President of the seventy-seventh General Assembly. We are confident 
that your extensive political experience will be crucial to the success of the work ahead. 
A maelstrom of challenges shakes the foundations of this building.   
The pandemic has been raging for three years now and 30.3% of humanity has yet to receive ""a single"" vaccine. 
The climate crisis and biodiversity loss are hitting us mercilessly and without distinction. In Pakistan, Puerto Rico, the 
Dominican Republic and Costa Rica, we are experiencing it first-hand today. Yet it is the most vulnerable countries who 
are stepping up our efforts, creating large areas of protection and conservation and increasing our adaptation and 
mitigation, while the biggest carbon emitters and those responsible for climate catastrophes remain unaccountable. 
The Russian invasion of Ukraine not only violated the principles of the Charter, but has triggered a humanitarian, fuel and 
financial crisis that will drive millions of people into food insecurity and poverty. 
The invasion also put our collective security system in check and provoked a renewed division and polarization in 
geopolitical and economic blocs between East and West, North and South.  
All this, at the very moment when we needed to build more bridges and fewer walls. When we could not lose sight of the 
situation in Yemen and Mali, in Myanmar and Syria, in Libya and Haiti, in Tigray and the Sahel; and between Israel and 
Palestine.  
The attacks on democracy and human rights, especially against women and girls, know no borders either. The decline of 
democracy is evident in Central Asia, Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific and in my own region, where the situation in 
Nicaragua demands urgent attention of the international community.  
In terms of rights, the cruelest example can be found in Afghanistan, where for the past year girls above the sixth grade 
have been banned from attending school, leaving them even more exposed to violence, poverty and exploitation. 
We have come to this Assembly to identify comprehensive solutions to the multiple crises we face because it is impossible 
to end poverty without empowering women and girls, to ensure respect for human rights without addressing climate 
change, or to address the reform of the international financial system without new parameters for the allocation of aid. 
First, for Costa Rica, the response to the multiple crises we face must have a rights-based approach.  Human rights, and 
the unvarnished respect or justification for human dignity and worth, are not just words; they are obligations undertaken 
by States, enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and all human 
rights treaties and instruments.  
They are also the expression of the legitimate and universal aspirations of each person, of all peoples, who are, after all, 
the ones who allow us to be in this solemn hall and speak on their behalf. 
Costa Rica is not exempt from challenges and gaps for the full fulfillment of human rights, the construction of a culture of 
peace and non-discrimination, and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We are aware that the fightagainst povert y, inequalit y and exclusi on require s human right s.  These are not and shoul d not be a stumbli ng block. They 
are nothing less than the only way. 
Costa Rica has never closed its doors to migrants who see in our country a route of passage or a destination to integrate into 
our society. In the last five years, we  have become the fourth country in the world in receiving more refugee applications 
per capita. But our economic situation and fiscal tightness, coupled with this phenomenon of massive migratory flows, limit 
our capacity for action and put at risk the adequate coverage that we have ensured in the past to these hundreds of thousands 
of people who have sought refuge on our soil. 
It is wit h a real sense of urgenc y that we require the support of the international communit y to address thi s challenge , whic h 
has bee n exacerbated not only by conflict and poverty, but also by the impact of climate change. 
In a context of multiple and accumulated crises, human rights must tread new paths. Costa Rica welcomes the recognition 
by the General Assembly on July 28 of the universal right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. For my country, 
this is a beacon  of hope,  comparable  to the proclamation  of the right  to water,  to development,  or to the Universal  Declaration 
of Human Rights, and the correct response to the triple planetary crisis of pollution, climate change and loss of biodiversity. 
This resolution is not a point of arrival, but a point of departure. Costa Rica will continue to work with Member States, the 
United Nations and all stakeholders to break down the silo mentality and provide effective solutions to human problems, 
particularly those who suffer the most, the most vulnerable, the most marginalized and excluded.  
True t o our commitment t o this right s agenda , Costa Rica ha s decide d to nominate it s name t o the Huma n Rights Council 
for the period 2023-2025. Costa Rica respectfully requests the suppor t of this General Assembly for its candidacy.  
In our country, you will find an ambitious actor who will watch over the rights of all people everywhere in th e world, as 
well as a country that will unhesitatingly commit to dialogue, mutual understanding, cooperation and solidarity in favor of 
human beings. 
Secondly, human security is key to global security . For my country, it is inconceivable that while millions of people are 
waiting  for vaccines,  medicines  or food  to save  their  lives,  the richest  countries  continue  to prioritize  their  resources  in 
armaments at the expense of people's well-being, climate health and equitable recovery. 
In 2021, global militar y spendi ng continue d to increase for the sevent h consecutive year t o reac h the highest figure we have 
ever seen in history.  
Costa  Rica today  reiterates  its call for a gradual  and sustained  reduction  in military  spending,  for the more  weapons  we 
produce, the more will escape even our best efforts at management and control. It is about prioritizing the lives and well-
being  of people  and the planet  over  the profits  to be made  from  weapons  and war.  It is about  investing  in and actively 
building  alternative  approaches  to security,  approaches  that facilitate  cooperation  and care  rather  than  competition  and 
violence.  
We are convinced that it is also possible to achieve peace and security without resorting to nuclear weapons. Because only 
the total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only guarantee against their use or threat of use, Costa Rica urges more States 
to sign and ratify  the Treaty  on the  Prohibition  of Nuclear  Weapons, as  well  as to adhere  to the Vienna Declaration  and 
Action  Plan. We  also urge the Russian  Federation  to cease  attacking  Ukraine,  its civilian  population  and critical 
infrastructure, to demilitarize the Zaporiyia plant and not to resort to nuclear coercion, which we condemn in the strongest 
terms.   
Costa Rica call s on both partie s to ensure respect , at all time s and in all circumstance s, for international huma n rights law 
and international humanitarian law. 
The third  transformative  solution  must  be financial.  Middle-income  countries  face  significant  inequalities  and 
challenges, such as increased fiscal stringency, which limit our capacity for action and investment and put the social fabric 
at risk. 
And although we are home to the highest percentage of poor people and migrants in the world, our categorization does not 
2 allow us to access official development assistance or obtain concessional financing on favorable and fair terms. 
It is therefore urgent to ""go beyond GDP per capita"" with new parameters for the allocation of aid, investment and 
international cooperation that take into account other aspects such as structural deficiencies, climate risks, market 
fluctuations and fiscal stability.  
The fourth action requires a higher level of ambition and urgency to address the triple planetary crisis of climate 
change, biodiversity l oss and pollution. And, for this, a healthy ocean and a blue economy approach are critical.   At 
the forefront of the natural disasters that hit our countries, droughts and heat waves, forest fires, floods never seen befor e, 
are the people.  
With them in mi nd, Costa Rica is leading, together with France and the United Kingdom, the High Ambition Coalition for 
Nature and People, which seeks the global conservation of 30% of the Earth and the ocean.  
We also support the Global Ocean Alliance, which reaffirms the  commitment to the conservation and protection of 30% of 
the ocean by 2030, and we adhere to the Ocean Conservation Pledge, promoted by the United States of America, to promote 
the conservation of 30% of the waters under national jurisdiction, which Costa Rica has achieved nine years ahead of 
schedule.  
In addition, we announced with President Macron our interest in co -hosting the Third United Nations Conference on the 
Ocean in 2025, and in holding a meeting in mid -2024 in Costa Rica that will bring together  the scientific community and 
civil society in the formulation of innovative solutions to improve ocean governance.  
The ocean is an immeasurable and critical resource for the continuity of life on Earth.  Therefore, on the International Day 
of Peace, Cost a Rica vehemently calls for the adoption of a Declaration of Peace for the Ocean.  We cannot survive as a 
species without our ocean.  We will not be able to fulfill our various obligations to the Sustainable Development Goals 
without a healthy ocean.  
We h ave much multilateral work ahead of us to safeguard marine resources and ocean health for this and future generations: 
reaching a global agreement on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, concluding a successful and 
transformative BBNJ tr eaty, and discussion regarding the governance of sub -seabed mining.  
Mr. President,  
On the International Day of Peace, let us declare peace with Nature and with our Ocean.  
Let us promote a new Agenda for Peace that strengthens our collective capacity to p revent conflicts and resolve existing 
ones with sustainable, locally driven solutions.  
Let us r enew the social contract between our governments and peoples, anchoring governance arrangements in human rights, 
trust, inclusion, protection and participation.  
Let us ensure gender parity and empower women and, in particular, girls in all spheres of life.  
Let us seek new methods to measure development that adequately reflect essential aspects such as environmental 
sustainability, inequalities and structural gaps, the quality of institutions and the prevalence of the rule of law.  
Let us build a more resilient, transparent and inclusive multilateral system and United Nations that better embraces the need s 
and perspectives of all, esp ecially within the Security Council.  
Let us do more to pave the way for the United Nations to fully rise to the occasion, to do all that it has the skills and 
determination to do, to help the UN and our own countries shift the course of our common destiny while there is still a 
destiny to shift.  
Let us act with conviction and courage, with determination and with a true sense of urgency. 
The time is now!  I thank you .", CRI,2022

 1  Remarks by The Honorable Gustav N. Aitaro Minister of State (Foreign Affairs) of the Republic of Palau General Debate of the Seventy-Seventh Session of the General Assembly 21 September 2022, New York   Mr. President,  Secretary-General,  Excellencies,  Ladies and Gentlemen,   I bring greetings from our President Surangel Whipps Jr. and the people of Palau. It is a great pleasure to be able to address this esteemed assembly, and at the outset, I wish to congratulate the President of this 77th General Assembly, Csaba Korosi, and pledge Palau’s support during the course of your tenure. I also wish to thank the President of the 76th General Assembly, a fellow islander from the Maldives who was gracious enough to take the long journey to Palau during his term, Honorable Minister Abdullah Shahid, for his astute leadership over the course of the last year.  Friends, we meet at a precarious time. Thankfully, the world has made great strides in collectively combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The people of Palau thank all our international partners and friends who came to our aid during this difficult time, particularly the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and others. The collaboration was successful in minimizing the impact of the pandemic in our small and vulnerable community.   Regrettably, while the world made great progress in pandemic recovery, new and unprecedented challenges have emerged. The war in Ukraine rages on, extolling damage to infrastructure,Check Against Delivery 
 2 homes, schools and cultural sites, killing innocent people, and continuing to terrorize the children of Ukraine. Palau continues to strongly condemn the war in Ukraine, and joins the international community in calling for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine’s sovereign borders. We also extend our prayers and solidarity to the people of Ukraine.  While war may be viewed as a heart attack, the climate crisis has been like diabetes, insidious and wearing us down, constantly with consistency, year after year. I’d like to take this opportunity to join fellow leaders to express my country’s deepest sympathy with our brothers and sisters in Pakistan, and those impacted by Hurricane Fiona, with respect to the awful climate devastation they have experienced. These catastrophes represent the unfortunate “new normal” for many in Small Island Developing States.   Climate change is not only about hurricanes and floods. It is about droughts. It is about wildfires. It is about our ability to provide drinking water and feed our people when our lakes run dry and our aquaculture facilities and reefs are ravaged by typhoons. We face all of these challenges and more in Palau today. It is our government’s inability to buy our children new textbooks or improve their nutrition programs because so much of our fiscal resources and energy is dedicated to address disaster relief. How many times do the people of our island of Kayangel have to rebuild their homes from storms before they give up. How many times does your home have to be swept away before it breaks your spirit?  Despite the challenges in this last year, we have begun to see glimmers of hope in the fight against climate change – youth, the private sector and civil service are more engaged than ever. Over 150,000 young people scaled Glasgow for COP26, provided much needed pressure for leaders to take action, and after 4 failed COPs, the Glasgow Climate Pact was finally adopted. Even large emitting countries like the United States and Australia have finally passed significant legislation to shift their domestic policies. None of these efforts get us to 1.5 degrees yet, but they represent a great step forward and we commend their efforts.   As the Russian-driven energy crisis has shown us, energy independence and renewable energy sources build resiliency into our economies. Palau felt the strain of skyrocketing energy costsCheck Against Delivery 
 3 and this is fueling our ambition to achieve 100% transition to renewable energy. In Palau, we have a saying “Sel om tobed el mora buai, em chisngekl mesa blim.” Translated it is like the English idiom “Don’t throw stones in glass houses.” It means before you criticize other people’s actions, look at your own.   It is in this spirit that our President Surangel Whipps Jr. has committed to Palau transitioning to 100% renewable energy by 2032. The message we want to send is clear:  despite our small size, our remote location, our lack of access to finance and technology, and the unique vulnerabilities of being a SIDS country, we are committed to moving towards a net-zero carbon world. We are committed because our planet and our children need us ALL to be committed.  Palau extends our sincere thank you to the Government of Japan who has committed a grant to help us update our country’s power grid to allow for this transition to renewables. We are grateful for your continued friendship and support.  Our small country also had the pleasure of Hosting the 7th Our Ocean Conference together with the United States in April of this year - this conference brought together more than 600 participants representing more than 70 foreign delegations and 150 non-state actors. It concluded with 410 commitments worth $16.35 billion. As a SIDS country, we thought it was particularly important to bring people from all over the world to Palau to show them first-hand the challenges we face as SIDS - whether it’s the plastic pollution, sea level rise or the impact on our fragile corals which underpin our major economic driver of blue tourism. The conference also highlighted the importance of ocean-based climate solutions, including shipping decarbonization, marine nature-based solutions, and offshore renewable energy, in keeping the 1.5-degree global warming target within reach and improving global climate resilience.  We are incredibly grateful for the wonderful partnership of the United States in co- hosting the Our Ocean Conference; the conference was a success in large part to your camaraderie and efforts. We also thank the generosity and support of the Republic of China – Taiwan for upgrading our conference venues; likewise we thank our partner Japan and the SasakawaCheck Against Delivery 
 4 Foundation for their generosity and significant technical support.  Many other partners also contributed to make this event a success for climate action.    As a blue ocean state, Palau has always been a leader in oceans issues and we will continue to be. As co-chair of the High-Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy with Norway, we are pleased to have recently welcomed the UK as our 17th member of the ocean panel, and are committed to working with them and all panel members to achieve 100% ocean management, for a sustainable ocean economy in which effective protection, sustainable production and equitable prosperity go hand-in-hand. Palau believes in the 30 by 30 Initiative and urges all member states to adopt management plans with a minimum MPA covering 30% of the EEZ.    As a large ocean state, we don’t believe there is a sustainable solution to oceans issues without incorporating management and rules in the high seas. The Pacific is disappointed that the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction IGC5 efforts could not conclude treaty text, as the preservation and fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction is long overdue as an extension of the world’s commitment to combatting climate change. The opportunity to establish regional MPAs, build maritime surveillance capacity, and facilitate the transfer of marine technology should not be further delayed. We owe it to our future generations to come together for the sustainable use of mankind’s common heritage.   Palau is a champion of the Moratorium on Deep Sea Mining. The deep sea makes up 90% of the marine environment and we cannot allow great harm to come to such biologically rich areas.  Before any nation is allowed to contract for deep sea mining projects, the global community must enact serious reform of the ISA and international regulations that comply with UNCLOS’ mission to preserve and protect the marine environment.     Let me now turn to an issue that deeply impacts both Palau and SIDS. The adoption of a Multidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI) cannot just be discussed in financial board rooms, for it has real impacts on the lives of island peoples.  UNDP’s own MVI analysis found that most SIDS are more vulnerable than their income level would suggest. We don’t come here as a proud people asking for handouts; however we need tailored solutions for our problems as SMALLCheck Against Delivery 
 5 countries, and meaningful access to financing. Adoption of the MVI facilitates climate action and can bring equity to global financing.    Mr. President, As Members should know, we are in Free Association with the United States via a Compact. In doing so, our people signal that we have shared values with the United States.  The United States also promised to help provide for our development needs after Palau gained independence from the US.  Since the time our Compact was signed though, some development has occurred – but too little. Our economy has not grown sufficiently and is fragile – as demonstrated by a contraction of more than 30% during the past five years. Much of this is due to the Covid pandemic, but some to geopolitics. We should not be so vulnerable. We have been forced to borrow more than we should have to, and we lack essential infrastructure.  A strength of our association is that it requires the governments of Palau and the U.S. to: periodically reconsider the relationship and its terms, reconsider Palau’s requirements for assistance for public services and economic development, and commits both of our governments to act on the conclusions.   The U.S. has initiated the required 30th Anniversary Review. It’s bureaucracy initially proposed unacceptably inadequate assistance, but President Biden has appointed an envoy who we trust will get his government to at least meet Palau’s minimum needs so that our people can attain a decent standard of living without having to leave. This is essential to enabling the relationship to endure, as my government wants.  It hopes that when we next address the General Assembly, we will be able to report an agreement in this regard. We need greater financial and programmatic assistance and will require these for the foreseeable future – and for as long as free association continues – but what we want most are government measures and public and private investment to grow our economy.   We are deeply grateful for the assistance that the U.S. and other governments, such as Taiwan and Japan, have provided, but we need more now, just as we need measures to combat and adapt to climate change’s rising seas. In our case, this includes concrete action to enable our people –Check Against Delivery 
 6 and , right now, especially, our hospital – to move from land that now regularly floods to the land that we have at higher levels.     Mr. President, we continue to view the United Nations as an important mechanism for achieving international peace and security and sustainable development for all countries, but in particular, for the voiceless and most vulnerable.  I reiterate in the strongest terms that this body can demonstrate leadership through accepting Taiwan into the UN system as a valuable contributor to our collective efforts at promoting peace and collaborating on international matters. Just most UN member states accept Taiwan passports, so too should the UN system recognize and incorporate the Taiwanese people and enrich this body with the benefits of their participation. Doing so is a realization of the core principles of the UN Charter. The Taiwanese people are part of the global community and a valuable partner in combating climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.  With the many challenges facing our planet and people, we need every person - including the 23 million people of Taiwan - to be part of the solutions.  When linguists studied our local Palauan language, they discovered that it was anchored in the word “heart” – “beltik er reng” translates into “found heart” means love. We are a people and a culture who navigate with our hearts, and that is the message I’d like to leave you with today. Palau chooses love of self, love of neighbor, love of planet, love as a virtue. We believe that choosing love is our only way forward for collective peace and prosperity.  There is no profit sufficiently large to be worth the price of war or the destruction of our planet. Above all the highs and lows of this year, I trust that this institution will take away the importance of unity and the respect for the rule of law. We are capable of overcoming the immense challenges of our time, but we must do so together.   Mesulang and Thank you.", PLW,2022
 GBR_77_2022,"Prime Minister Liz Truss’s speech  
to the UN General Assembly  
21 September 2022  
 
 
Mr President, your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,  
At the time of its foundation, the United Nations was a beacon of 
promise.  
In the aftermath of the Second World War, this building symbolised the 
end of aggression.  
For many decades the UN has helped to deliver stability and security in 
much of the world.  
It has provided a place for nations to work together on shared 
challenges.  
And it has promoted the principles of sovereignty and self -determination 
even through the Cold War and its aftermath.  
But today those principles, that have defined our lives since the dark 
days of the 1940s, are fracturing. 
For the first time in the history of this assembly we are meeting during a 
large- scale war of aggression in Europe. 
And authoritarian states are undermining stability and security around 
the world.  
Geopolitics is entering a new era – one that requires those who believe 
in the founding principles of the United Nations to stand up and be 
counted.In the United Kingdom we are entering a new era too.  
I join you here just two days after Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 
was laid to rest.  
We deeply mourn her passing and we pay tribute to her service.  
She was the rock on which modern Britain was built.  
And she symbolised the post -war values on which this organisation was 
founded.  
Our constitutional monarchy, underpinned by a democratic society, has 
delivered stability and progress.  
Her Late Majesty transcended difference and healed division. We saw 
this in her visits to post -apartheid South Africa and the Republic of 
Ireland.  
When she addressed this General Assembly 65 years ago she warned 
that it was vital not only to have strong ideals but also to have the 
political will to deliver on them.  
Now we must show that will.  
We must fight to defend those ideals.  
And we must deliver on them for all our people.  
And as we say farewell to our Late Queen, the UK opens a new chapter 
– a new Carolean age – u nder His Majesty King Charles III.  
We want this era to be one of hope and progress…  
One in which we defend the values of individual liberty, self -
determination and equality before the law…  
One in which we ensure that freedom and democracy prevail for all 
people…And one in which we deliver on the commitments that Her Late Majesty 
the Queen made here 65 years ago.  
This is about what we do in the United Kingdom and what we do as 
member states of the UN.  
So today I will set out what steps we are taking at  home in the UK and 
our proposed blueprint for the new era we are now in – the new 
partnerships and new instruments we need to collectively adopt.  
Our commitment to hope and progress must begin at home – in the lives 
of each and every citizen that we serve. 
Our strength as a nation comes from the strong foundations of freedom 
and democracy.  
Democracy gives people the right to choose their own path. And it 
evolves to reflect the aspirations of citizens.  
It unleashes enterprise, ideas, and opportunity. And it  protects the 
freedoms that are at the very core of our humanity.  
By contrast, autocracies sow the seeds of their own demise by 
suppressing their citizens.  
They are fundamentally rigid and unable to adapt. Any short -term gains 
are eroded in the long term because these societies stifle the aspiration 
and creativity which are vital to long- term growth.  
A country where Artificial Intelligence acts as judge and jury, where there 
are no human rights and no fundamental freedoms, is not the kind of 
place anyone truly wants to live.  
It is not the kind of world we want to build. 
But we cannot simply assume there will be a democratic future.  
There is a real struggle going on between different forms of society – 
between democracies and autocracies. Unless democratic so cietiesdeliver on the economy and security our citizens expect, we will fall 
behind.  
We need to keep improving and renewing what we do for the new era, 
demonstrating that democracy delivers.  
As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, I am determined that we will 
deliver the progress that people expect.  
I will lead a new Britain for a new era.  
Firstly, this begins with growth and building a British economy that 
rewards enterprise and attracts investment.  
Our long- term aim is to get our economy growing at an average of 2.5%.  
We need this growth to deliver investment around our country, to deliver 
the jobs and high wages that people expect, and to deliver public 
services like the National Health Service.  
We want people to keep more of the money they earn, so they can have 
more control over their lives and can contribute to the future.  
Secondly, it means securing affordable and reliable supplies of energy.  
We are cutting off the toxic power and pipelines from authoritarian 
regimes and strengthening our energy resi lience.  
We will ensure we cannot be coerced or harmed by the reckless actions 
of rogue actors abroad. 
We will transition to a future based on renewable and nuclear 
energywhile ensuring that the gas used during that transition is from 
reliable sources including our own North Sea production.  
We will be a net energy exporter by 2040. 
Thirdly, we are safeguarding the security of our economy – the supply 
chains, the critical minerals, the food, and the technology that drives 
growth and protects the health and lives of our people.We won’t be strategically dependent on those who seek to weaponise 
the global economy.  
Instead, we are reforming our economy to get Britain moving – and we 
want to work with our allies so we can all move forward together.  
The free world needs this economic strength and resilience to push back 
against authoritarian aggression and win this new era of strategic 
competition.  
We must do this together.  
So we are building new partnerships around the world.  
We are fortifying our deep security alliances in Europe and beyond 
through NATO and the Joint Expeditionary Force.  
We are deepening our links with fellow democracies like India, Israel, 
Indonesia and South Africa.  
We are building new security ties with our friends in the Indo- Pacific and 
the Gulf.  
We have shown leadership on free and fair trade, striking trade 
agreements with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and many others, 
andwe are in the process of acceding to the Trans -Pacific Partnership.  
Rather than exerting influence through debt, aggression, and taking 
control of critical infrastructure and minerals, we are building strategic 
ties based on mutual benefit and trust. 
And we are deepening partnerships like the G7 and the Commonwealth.  
We must also collectively extend a hand of friendship to those parts of 
the world that have too often been left behind and left vulnerable to 
global challenges…  
Whether it’s the Pacific or Caribbean Island states dealing with the 
impact of climate change, or the Western Balkans dealing with persistent 
threats to  their stability.The UK is providing funding, using the might of the City of London and 
our security capabilities to provide better alternatives to those offered by 
malign regimes.  
The resolute international response to Ukraine has shown how we can 
deliver decisive collective action.  
The response has been built on partnerships and alliances and also on 
being prepared to use new instruments – unprecedented sanctions, 
diplomatic action, and rapid military support.  
There has been a strength of collective purpose – we have met many 
times, spoken many times on the phone, we have made things happen.  
Now we must use these instruments in a more systematic way to push 
back on the economic aggression of authoritarian regimes.  
The G7 and our like- minded partners should act as an economic NATO, 
collectively defending our prosperity.  
If the economy of a partner is being targeted by an aggressive regime 
we should act to support them. All for one and one for all.  
Through the G7’s $600 billion Partnership for Global Infrastructure and 
Investment we are providing an honest, reliable alternative on 
infrastructure investment around the world, free from debt with strings 
attached.  
And we must go further to friendshore our supply chains and end 
strategic dependence.  
This is how we will build collective security, strengthen our resilience and 
safeguard freedom and democracy.  
But we cannot let up on dealing with the crisis we face today.  
No-one is threatening Russia.  
Yet we meet here this evening…In Ukraine, barbarous weapons are being used to kill and maim people,  
Rape is being used as an instrument of war,  
Families are being torn apart. 
And this morning we have seen Putin trying to justify his catastrophic 
failures.  
He is doubling down by sending even more reservists to a terrible fate.  
He is desperately trying to claim the mantle of democracy for a regime 
without human rights or freedoms.  
And he is making yet more bogus claims and sabre- rattling threats.  
This will not work.  The international alliance is strong and Ukraine is 
strong.  
The contrast between Russia’s conduct and Ukraine’s brave, dignified 
First Lady, Olena Zelenska, who is here at the UN today, could not be 
more stark.  
The Ukrainians are not just defending their own country – they are 
defending our values and the security of the whole world.  
That’s why we must act.  
That’s why the UK will spend 3% of GDP on defence by 2030, 
maintaining our position as the leading security actor in Europe.  
And that’s why – at this crucial moment in the conflict – I pledge that  we 
will sustain or increase our military support to Ukraine, for as long as it 
takes.  
New UK weapons are arriving in Ukraine as I speak – including more 
MLRS rockets.  
We will not rest until Ukraine prevails.In all of these areas, on all of these fronts, the time to act is now.  
This is a decisive moment in our history, in the history of this 
organisation, and in the history of freedom.  
The story of 2022 could have been that of an authoritarian state rolling 
its tanks over the border of a peaceful neighbour and subjugating its 
people.  
Instead, it is the story of freedom fighting back.  
In the face of rising aggression we have shown we have the power to act 
and the resolve to see it through. 
But this cannot be a one- off. 
This must be a new era in which we commit to ourselves, our citizens, 
and this institution that we will do whatever it takes – whatever it takes to 
deliver for our people and defend our values.  
As we mourn our Late Queen and remember her call to this Assembly, 
we must devote ourselves to this t ask. 
Britain’s commitment to this is total.  
We will be a dynamic, reliable and trustworthy partner.  
Together with our friends and allies around the world, we will continue to 
champion freedom, sovereignty and democracy.  
And together we can define this new era as one of hope and progress.  
Thank you.

Principal Organs  particularly the Economic and Social Council 
(ECOSOC) , which Botswana was honoured to lead as its 77th 
President. 
 4. I am delighted that t he two Presidents  worked very 
cooperatively on  addressing  Vaccine Equity, the Sustainable 
Development of Africa,  Financing for a sustainable recovery  
and the nexus between natural resources and sustainable 
developmen t, among other priorities.  Close collaboration 
among UN Principal Organs of the United Nations is beneficial, 
and must be promoted.  
 
Mr. President,     
5. Botswana endorses your choice of the theme  for this Session , 
that is , “A Watershed Moment : Transformative 
Solutions to Interlocking Challenges .”  We concur with 
your observation  that the current global challenges, namely , 
the COVID -19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine , Humanitarian 
Challenges  and Climate Change are complex and 
interconnected hence require transformative solutions.   
 
6. Given the interconnectedness of these challenges, it is evident 
that they can only be effectively addressed in a holistic 
approach. This further demonstrates the enduring relevance  
of the UN Charter, which  77 years ago , established the three 
founding pillars of the UN system  namely,  human rights , 
peace and security , and development  as inter related  and 
mutually reinforcing. 
  
7. As UN Member States , we should look no further for these 
solutions than in the already existing  key multilater al 
frameworks , among these,  the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development  and its SDGs , the Paris  
Agreement , the UN 75th Anniversary  Declaration  as well 
as the outcomes of major UN meetings.  
 
8. This Session gives us an opportunity to reaffirm our 
commitment to these solutions . In his comprehensive report 
on Our Common Agenda , the Secretary -General has 
offered us a boost with concrete ideas and re commendations 
to accelerate implementation of the 2030 Agenda and close 
the existing gaps in our multilateral frameworks.   
 
      Mr. President,  
9. I wish therefore, to preface my remarks, through which I will 
share my country’s progress in recovering from the COVID -19 
and towards a transformative and sustainable development, 
by reminding this auspicious body of Botswana’s road to 
development.  
 
10. Many in this room may o nly know the Botswana of now, which 
is an upper middle income economy. T his is a status that we 
are proud of, given that when we attained  our independence 
 only 5 6 years ago, we were among the poorest in the world.  
However, we were very fortunate to discove r what has turned 
out to be the World’s largest diamond reserve, across the 
Kimberly belt.  
 
11. For those less acquainted with the development path we have 
travelled as a country, this is not the entire reflection of the 
Botswana story. Our story is based on the humanity, the 
principled and the tenacity that we have as a people, as 
Batswana . It is the story  of the wisdom of our 
forefathers who avoided the misfortune that often 
accompanied the d iscovery and exploitation of 
minerals in other parts of the world, and electing 
instead, to  turn the discovery  of diamonds into a story 
for development.  Botswana as a nation,  would never have 
been able to realise this development had we not held firmly 
to our belief in the principles  of democracy, centred on the 
rule of law, good governance and the protection  and 
enjoyment  of the basic human rights by our people .  
 
Mr. President , 
12. I must  however,  admit that we face an uphill battle in our 
investment efforts to attract  investors to help us to diversity 
our economy away from dependence on diamonds. 
   
13. I have  stood before this General Assembly and  I have 
engaged at different fora when the opportunity arises, to 
share  the Botswana story  with a view to encouraging  
partnerships to augment our efforts towards diversification .  I 
trust that those that are attentive to our call are more in 
number, and  I firmly believe that  they too, aspire to  share a 
part in our story.  In the meantime, diamonds are still the 
bedrock of our economy. It is in this respect, that the words 
of the Secretary G eneral António Guterres , and the call for a 
“Common Agenda”, resonate with me.  
 
14. I liked in particular, the call by the Secretary G eneral for a 
global view  whereby “Power, wealth and opportunity are 
shared more broadly and fairly at the international level .” For 
my country, this translates into a fair and equitable 
opportunity to use the resources that we have to develop our 
people and give them an equal opportunity to contribute and 
share in global wealth.  
 
15. As we continue to advocate for the Kimberly Proc ess (KP), I 
wish to remind this august body  that Botswana’s Story is 
unquestionable proof and living testimony , that 
diamonds, with good governance, are for 
 development.  In fact , DIAMONDS ARE A SERIOUS 
MATTER OF  LIVELIHOOD S!. 
 
16. I will be host ing a side event on Diamonds for Development  
later this evening , through which I hope to further broaden 
conversations and allow our partners, both within the United 
Nations,  government s, civil society and the private sector, to 
join us in ensuring that my co untry, BOTSWANA , will also be 
part of the United Nations  family espoused around s hared 
power, wealth  and opportunity as we endeavour to realise the 
2030 Agenda.  
 
Towards A Sustainable and Transformative Recovery  
from the COVID -19 Pandemic  
 
Mr. President , 
17. Despite our challenges, my Government continues to play its 
part to contribute to the international agenda and in ensuring 
that access to medicines by our people is part and parcel of 
their healthcare  while ensuring that the economy also  
recover s from the Pandemic .  
 
18. Vaccin e rollout  remain s a pre -condition for  a sustainable 
recovery . Yet many countries in the global South especially 
 Africa have not met the WHO’s target of 70% of their 
populations being fully vaccinated by mid-2022. This 
underscores the urgent need to continue promoting vaccine 
equity  through international solidarity  as well as  address ing 
vaccine hesitancy  by countering disinformation and raising 
awareness about the science -backed facts regarding the  
effectiveness  and safety of the vaccines .  
 
19. Despite  the challenges we  encounter ed, which were common 
to many developing countries, Botswana  has procured 
enough vaccines to administer to all eligible groups, thus 
enabling significant  progress  with 64% of our population now 
fully vaccinated . However, more needs to be done.  
 
 
20. It is in this context that Botswana continues to play an active 
role on this matter and recently also joined other Member 
States in co -sponsoring the General Assembly Resolution 
calling for the convening of a High -Level Meeting on 
Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response  
during the 78th Session of the General Assembly.  We also 
continue to actively participate in the ongoing process 
towards the possible elaboration of a Pandemic treaty at the 
World Health Organisation in Geneva. We believe that such a 
legally binding instrument will strengthen  existing global 
 mechanism s to address and react more speedily to health 
emergencies.  
 
        Mr. President ,  
21. I am pleased to inform you that as part of overcoming  the 
challenges of global vaccine inequity , and in line with our 
commitment to Build Back Better  and in  a transformative 
manner, the Government of Botswana has approved the 
manufacturing of the patent -free Corbevax COVID -19 
vaccine, and the construction of a vaccine manufacturing 
plant has already commenced.  
 
22. Additionally,  the facility will produce  cancer treatment  and 
next generation cell -based immunotherapy . This initiative is 
being undertaken in partnership with NantWorks, the Texas 
Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and the 
Baylor College of Medicine. This partnership  will enhance 
Botswana’s capacity in  human  vaccine production , contribute 
to our goal of building a knowledge -based economy, and help 
in preparations for future pandemics . 
 
   Mr President,  
23. Botswana ’s recovery plans include  strengthening  the 
country’s vast  social protection system  to ensure th e 
inclusivity of vulnerable  groups , persons living with 
 disabilit ies, which will go a long way in facilitating equal 
enjoyment of their rights while broadening the accountability 
framework  as we recently acceded to the Convention on  the 
Rights of  Persons w ith Disabilit ies (CRPD) . 
 
24. In this regard, My Government has set a medium to long term 
Economic Recovery and Transformation Plan (ERTP)  
intended at fast tracking recovery efforts while advancing the 
implementation 2030 Agenda and its Goals.  
 
Mr. President , 
25. In order to achieve sustainable development , adequate 
financing is  needed for  the success of our recovery efforts 
from the pandemic and acceleration of implementation of the 
2030 Agenda during this Decade of Action . Effective 
mobilisation of domestic and international financial resources 
as well as their prudent utilisation is therefore  imperative.  
  
26. I therefore, reiterate calls for development partners to scale 
up and fulfil their Official Development Assistance  (ODA)  
commitments  and our efforts in attaining long -term 
development sustainability. 
  
 
Mr. President ,  
27. In addition to international funding, it should be noted that 
transformati ve agendas require the effective implementation 
by Governments and associated stakeholders as well as a 
sense of ownership by all stakeholders , and a buy-in from the 
people we serve. This decisive moment of the myriad of 
challenges we face, demands that we challenge ourselves 
even more.  
 
28. My Government has thus initiated the Reset Agenda , 
inspired by the need for collective , inclusive and  coordinated 
efforts toward s the transformative agenda. We are 
accelerating digitisation in the delivery of services, driven by 
innovation and creativity.  Our people are responding to the 
technology driven solutions and they too are demonstrating 
the reor ientation of their disposition as well as conceptual 
agility to venture into new frontiers of doing things differently. 
A full embrace of this mind -set-change is an inspirational 
approach to effective implementation of government policies, 
programmes , proj ects and business activities and indeed the 
Sustainable Development Goals. 
 29. The realisation of transformative solutions to the current 
social and economic challenges will require solidarity both 
within and between countries. As Chair of the  Landlocked 
Developing Countries (LLDCs) , many of who m are also 
characterised as Least developed and Small States, Botswana  
expresses solidarity with fellow UN Member States, in special 
situations, particularly the distinct and peculiar challenges 
faced by the LDCs  and the SIDS  in their efforts to Build Back 
Better  and recover sustainably from the p andemic.  
 
30. In line with the repeated position of our sub-regional body 
SADC, I also wish to express sol idarity with our north -eastern 
neighbour Zimbabwe and call for  the removal of Unilateral 
Coercive Measures  targeted at that country. While we are 
confident of the resilience and resolve of Zimbabwe as well as 
its economic transformation pros pects, we are concerned that 
such measures are  not advancing the  cause and  livelihoods of 
innocent Zimbabweans .  
 
Addressing the Climate Crisis  
 
        Mr. President,  
31. This year we continue to witness extreme weather events that 
point to the escalating severity of the climate crisis. Decisive 
 implementation of t he bold climate action spelled out in the 
Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Climate Pact  is 
therefore needed now to prevent the worst implications.  
 
32. Botswana  remain s committed to our 15% carbon emission 
reduction target by 2030, as indicated in our Nationally 
Determined Contribution s and reconfirm ed in our Climate 
Change Policy adopted in 2021. The policy addresses access 
to climate finance, clean technologies and renewable energy.  
 
Mr. President,  
33. Climate ambitions will not translate into climate action in 
developing countries if they remain inadequately funded. We 
are therefore  pleased that new financial pledges to support 
adaptation in developing countries were made at COP 26 in 
Glasgow , United  Kingdom . 
 
34. It is our hope that these commitments will be fulfilled 
expeditiously in order to enable accelerated implementation 
particula rly in Africa, a region that contributes minimally to 
climate change but is regrettably the most affected.   
 
35. In this context, we are op timistic that COP 27, to  be held in 
Sharm el -Sheik, Egypt,  on African soil, will further inspire 
 ambitious climate action  and deliver more adaptation 
resources for Africa and other vulnerable regions.  
 
36. Drawing from this inspiration, Botswana in collaboration with 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC ) and various stakeholders, convened the Climate 
Adaptation Week 2022 from 22 to 26 August 2022 in 
Gaborone under the theme ‘ Transformations in advancing 
the formulations and implementation of National 
Adaptation Plans ( NAPS )”.   
 
37. The Expo succeeded in promoting the exchange of 
experiences and foster ing partnerships between a wide range 
of actors and stakeholders on how to advance National 
Adaptation Plans (NAPs).  
The War in Ukraine and Other Threats to International 
Peace and Security  
 
Mr. President , 
  
38. On 2nd March  this year , Botswana was among the 141 Member 
States that voted in favour of the General Assembly resolution 
which  demanded an end to the invasion of Ukraine. 
  
39. With that vote we were  reaffirm ing the purposes and 
principles of the UN Charter  particularly its Articles  1 and 
2, which underscore the need for peaceful settlement of 
disputes a s well as respect for sovereignty and territorial 
integrity.  The Charter is a binding instrument of international 
law, therefore all peace -loving nations  ought to adhere to its 
letter and spirit under all circumstances.  
 
40. We therefore continue to call on all parties to recommit to 
finding a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict through 
diplomacy and dialogue. The UN-brokered talks that resulted 
in the Russian Federation and Ukraine signing an agreement 
on the Black Sea Grain Initiative  are a testament that 
when given a chance , diplomacy and dialogue  can yield 
results . If nothing else, the end of the second Wo rld War and 
the founding of the United Nations in 1945, has demonstrated  
that only if we approach conflict based on solidarity and 
working together, can we find peace.  
 
41. I commend  the Secretary -General and the UN system 
organizations and other stakeholders , including neighbouring 
countries such as Poland for rising to the challenge  to address  
humanitarian needs  in Ukraine and other crisis situation s. 
 42. As we continue to seek amicable redress of this worrying 
conflict, i t is imp ortant that the UN system be adequately 
resourced given its critical  work of saving lives and alleviat ing 
the suffering of victims of armed conflict, climate change and 
other disasters .  
 
 
43. Mr President,  
We, the collective Member States of the United Nations, have 
the responsibility and mandate to strength international law, 
promote human rights and gender equality, and most crucial 
to protect civilians in challenging peacekeeping environments. 
In this con text, Botswana shares the same ideals with many 
of you present here today on the principle of Responsibility 
to Protect (R2P).  
 
44. Mr President,  
As has already been acknowledged at the  2005 World 
Summit, States have the primary responsibility to protect 
their own populations from genocide, ethnic cleansing, war 
crimes and crimes against humanity. As part of the  Group of 
Friends on Responsibility to Protect which Botswana is 
Co-Chair together with Costa Rica and Denmark, we will 
continue to ensure that the me mbership of the United Nations 
 pays attention to this important responsibility to reinforce 
needed global action.  
 
45. In Southern Africa,  we remain actively engaged  through our 
sub-regional organisation , the Southern African 
Development Community  (SADC) , in addressing  the 
threat posed by  terrorism and violent extremism to peace and 
security  in our sub-region.   
 
The UN’s Fitness for Purpose  
 
        Mr. President,  
46. The UN’s response to today’s crises is a clear demonstration 
of its indispensability as the foremost organisation in 
addressing global issues. From its system -wide response  to 
COVID -19 to its swift action in relation to the  humanitarian 
crisis in Ukraine  and other crises situations,  the UN has proven 
to be fit for purpose.  
 
47. Nonetheless, there remains ample room for improving the 
organisation’s effectiveness in fulfilling the principles and 
purposes of the UN Charter . In this connection , we welcome  
recent reforms and proposals aimed at strengthening  the UN 
system  and enhancing its relevance in addressing 
contemporary global challenges. 
  
48. These efforts include the Secretary -General’s  development , 
management , peace and security , human rights and 
humanitarian pillar reforms , which are aimed at  enhanc ing 
the Secretariat’s  agility, accountability,  and effectiveness in  
mandate implementation.  
 
49. Also noteworthy is  General Assembly Resolution 76/262  
adopted in April by  consensus  mandating that the Assembly  
automatically meet s within ten (10) days, if a veto is used in 
the Security Council  by one of its five permanent members . 
It is our considered view that the resolution is an important 
accountability step that enhances the General Assembly’s 
voice on peace and security matters.   
 
50. The fact that the General A ssembly had to adopt a resolution 
on the use of veto underscore s the need to enhance the 
responsiveness  and representative nature of the Security 
Council .  I therefore r eaffirm  Botswana’s support  of a reform 
of the Council in line with the  Common African Position  which 
is reflected in the Ezulwini Consensus  and the Sirte 
Declaration . 
 
51.  The work to revitalis e the General Assembly  is equally 
important and must continue, with a view to reinforce the role 
 of this most universally representative august body. During 
our Presidency of UN Economic and Social Council 
(ECOSOC ), we were delighted as Botswana to work together 
with other Bureau members to implement the provisions of 
General Assembly resolution 75/290 A and B on strength ening 
of the Council and the High -Level Political Forum (HLPF). 
ECOSOC is key in  implementation of the 2030 Agenda.     
 
Mr. Presi dent,  
 
52. For a small country like mine, the reform of the United Nations 
is important, only in as far as it will ensure the equal  voice of 
Member States, regardless of size. My Government, and I 
personally, are therefore eager to have our own people 
represented and employed with in the United States system. 
With our Presidency of the ECOSOC, I believe we have 
demonstrated our capability, incl uding the capacity of our 
youth, who have received positive reviews from their support 
of the ECOSOC Secretariat  during our tenure. We would 
however, love to see such accolades turn ing into real 
opportunities for  absorption throughou t the employ and 
hierarchy of the Organisation , particularly for our Youth. 
 53.  As I conclu de my remarks , Mr. President , let me reassure 
you that you can count on Botswana’s support and 
constructive engagement towards the successful 
implementation of the programme of work of the 77th Session 
of the General Assembly.  I hope that Botswana can also 
rely on the UN system and our developm ent partners 
and the wider international community to help us 
realise the AGENDA 2030 and transforms our people 
and country into a developed nation by 2036.  
 
I thank you.", BWA,2022

STATEMENT DELIVERED BY  
H. E. PRESIDENT ADAMA BARROW  
AT THE GENERAL DEBATE OF THE  
77TH SESSION OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY  
NEW YORK  
22ND SEPTEMBER 20221 
 
 Mr. President,  
Mr. Secretary -General,  
Your Majesties,  
Excellencies, Heads of State and Government,  
Heads of Delegation,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
I bring you warm greetings from the People of The 
Gambia  and wish that we have a successful and 
fruitful 77th Session.2 
 
   
It is regrettable that we could not convene a proper 
general summit over the last two y ears due to the 
Covid -19 outbreak. Allow me, therefore, to pay a 
special tribute to the millions of people who 
succumbed to the pandemic worldwide . In their 
memory, we must commit ourselves to  better 
pandemic preparedness and response.3 
 
 Mr. President, my delegation congratulates you on 
your efficient role as President of the General 
Assembly, and I assure you of The Gambia’s support 
during your tenure. We also felicitate the S ecretary -
General for ably steering the affairs of the UN during 
what has become  one of the most challenging times 
of the century.   
 
Mr. President,4 
 
 The numerous interlocking global challenges 
requiring coordinated global action make it most 
pressing for us to rise to the occasion. This makes the 
theme “A Watershed Moment: transformative 
challenges to interlocking challenges” quite 
appropriate.5 
 
 In the thick of all the complexities confronting world 
leaders, we must underscore the centrality of the 
United Nation’s unique role and potential to make a 
huge difference  in the lives of the people . Durable 
solutions that match the magnitude and intensity of 
the never -ending challenges  remain the Assembly’s 
greatest challenge .6 
 
 The situation calls for new perceptions, new 
approaches, new partnerships,  renewed 
commitments , and increased resource level s equal to 
the scale of both current and emerging challenges. To 
recover as a global family, we must muster the 
requisite courage and political will , and take 
advantage of the opportunities that go with the global 
crises.  
 
Mr. President,7 
 
 The current cost -of-living crisis across the world is a 
wake -up call for immediate global response to 
alleviate the suffering and poverty that hold our 
nations to ransom . The global inflationary trends, 
food insecurity , and the energy crisis compound the 
natural disasters that continue to cause havoc around 
the world. The need for relief grows by the day, yet 
global efforts appear to be less and less effective.8 
 
 In this connection, my  delegation fully welcomes the 
establishment of the Secretary -General’s Global 
Crisis Resp onse Group, and eagerly look s forward to 
concrete action -oriented recommendations and 
solutions. As one of the hard -hit developing 
countries, The Gambia stands ready to cooperate with 
the Group to find real solutions for immediate relief.  
 
Mr. President,9 
 
 We have come to this Summit with gratitude for the 
partnerships and support extended to us from 2016 to 
date.  
 
Mr. Secretary General, w e thank you personally and 
the entire  UN Body for the continued support of our 
peacebuilding  and reconciliation efforts. The Gambia 
has come a long way from dictatorship and has 
transitioned into a true  multiparty democracy.10 
 
 Following the 2021 Presidential Election and the 
Legislative Elections  this year , the consolidation 
process is gaining momentum . We will step up 
reforming and strengthening our national institution s 
to sustain  a robust democracy where human rights and 
fundamental freedoms underpin our national policies, 
programmes and development effort s.11 
 
 As we prepare  to end the current electoral cycle with 
the 2023 Local Government Elections, we are proud 
that The Gambia now has  multiple  political parties  
and vibrant civil society organi sations , with  a sharp 
rise in public participation in national affairs.12 
 
 Amid the socio -economic challenges that beset our 
nation , characterised by reduced  touris m 
engagements , inflation, food  and energy insecurity , 
and modest economic growth , we are developing a 
new National Development Plan (NDP) 2022 -2026,  
to succeed the current NDP.13 
 
 With this new Plan, we seek to advance the pursuit of 
our national priorities, including the Sustainable 
Development Goals and the Agenda 2063 of the 
Afric an Union. We, therefore, solicit the  support of 
the UN system , as well as our friends and 
development partners.14 
 
 Our goal is to recover and grow our economy, 
transform digitally , and consolidate our democratic 
gains. Our resolve is to uplift our people from 
poverty, secure their livelihoods,  and create new 
avenues to transition into a prosper ous, peaceful , and 
stable nation.  
 
Because t he youth and women form the greater 
majority of our population , the Government will 
continue to empower them.15 
 
 Like all other genuine nations, we are committed to 
the global consensus that no country should be left 
behind in this Decade of Action.  
 
Despite its size and economic status, The Gambia is  
at the forefront of fighting climate change through 
ambitious national action plans, and we look forward 
to participating effectively in COP27 in Egypt and the 
Fifth United Nations Conference on Least Develop 
Countries (LDCs) in Qatar.16 
 
 Mr. President,  
 
Accelerating development in Africa hinges on 
addressing the underlying causes of insecurity and 
underdevelopment. As a continent, our collective 
goal is to have a peaceful Africa where  the people 
enjoy the dividends of peace, stability , and prosperity.  
 
African Governments are committed to silencing the 
guns on the continent as a strategic objective. For this17 
 
 reason, we ask the United Nations and the 
international community to shoulder  their fair share 
of the burden of the African Union peace endeavours.   
 
 
 
Our experience  with keeping the peace in Africa is 
marked by isolated efforts in many instances. Africa 
must be provided with adequate equipment  and the18 
 
 means  to fully play its peace enforcement role on 
behalf of the  international community.  
 
 
 
 
As a longstanding troop -and-police  contributing 
country, The Gambia will continue to support the 
Secretary -General’s Action for Peacekeeping19 
 
 Initiative , and w e welcome its reinforcement through 
the Action for Peacekeeping Stra tegy.  
 
We are committed to improving the capacity of our 
officers through increased pre -deployment training, 
innovative partnerships, and more gender balanced  
peacekeeping deployment approache s. 
 We must, however, review and do more to address 
the frequent deadly  attacks against peacekeepers in 
Mission areas by giving them realistic mandates. As20 
 
 a sitting member of the African Union Peace and 
Security Council, The Gambia’s commitment to 
peace and security in Africa and beyond remains 
unwavering.  
 
 
Mr. President,  
We have ongoing conflicts on our continent that need 
urgent international attention. The complexity  of the 
challenges in the Sahel dictates  multipronged21 
 
 approaches and interventions that would ensure 
sustainable peace and stability. So, we must  
reconsider  our assumptions on this region and seek 
forward -looking solutions that empower the citizens.  
 
 
The current security and governance situation in 
Libya equally deserves a fresh thrust  from the 
international community. We call on the contending22 
 
 parties on the ground to give the people a chance to 
live and coexist in peace.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
 
Moroccan sovereignty and territorial rights over its 
Sahara region should be recognised  by all. In this 
regard,  The Government of The Gambia reaffirms its 
strong support for the Moroccan Autonomy Initiative,23 
 
 which convincingly serves as a realistic compromise  
in accordance with UN resolutions.   
 
 
 
Developments in the Horn of Africa also continue to 
be a source of serious concern. We request  the leaders 
of the region and the international community to 
explore new options to restore peace in the area.24 
 
 We must equally come together to jointly assist the 
region to combat  terrorism through g reater 
cooperation and intelligence sharing.  
The humanitarian crisis is enormous and call s for 
considerable  international emergency aid.  
 
Mr. President,25 
 
 Reverting to other important matters of global 
concern , we entreat the Unites States to end the 
longs tanding embargo imposed on Cuba.   
The reason is that g lobal solidarity and friendly 
cooperation sh ould define relations between Member 
States of the United Nations.  
 
In the Middle East, the Israeli -Palestinian Conflict 
needs a new impetus for lasting peace. As a people, 
the Palestinians deserve a state of their own, hence we26 
 
 call for a fresh peace i nitiative  that include s the 
revival of the Arab Peace Initiative.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
We remain d eeply disturbed by the horrors and 
humanitarian catastrophe arising from t he ongoing 
Russia -Ukraine war. The destabilising  global 
economic conditions imposed on the rest of the world 
are unbearable.27 
 
  
 
In Africa and elsewhere, the cost-of-living crisis  and 
the biting inflation , with food and energy insecurity , 
are devastating our economies and continue to 
frustrate pandemic recovery efforts. Additionally, the 
debt burden ha s reached cris is levels . We call for 
general debt relief.28 
 
  
We implore  Russia and Ukraine to heed the global 
plea for  political dialogue and end the  war. Africa  is 
simply asking for global peace and friendly relations. 
Our survival and progress depend on global peace and 
stability . 
 
Mr. President,29 
 
  
The plight of the Rohingya remain a matter of grave 
concern to The Gambia . We call on  the Myanmar 
Government to compl y with the rulings of the 
International Court of Justice  and end all human 
rights violations against the Rohingya. The Gambia 
will continue to defend their rights.  
 
Mr. President,30 
 
 As a responsible member of the international 
community, The Gambia  conside rs Taiwan as part of 
the Peoples Republic of China , and we advocate the 
adoption of the One -China policy.  
 
We urge the international community, therefore, to 
fully respect China’s sovereignty over Taiwan and 
avoid actions  that undermine global peace.31 
 
 The Gambia fully supports the Secretary -General’s 
call for transformation and global solidarity in the 
landmark report “ Our Common Agenda ”. In the 
same vein, we support his  efforts to convene the 
Summit of the Future and the Sustainable 
Development Goals Summit  next year.  
 
The renewal of global  solidarity and regard for the 
less fortunate necessitate that we commit ourselves, 
once again, to leaving no one behind.32 
 
 Mr. President,  
 
Africa will continue to demand its rightful place in the 
permanent membership category of the Security 
Council ; thus, t he negotiations must produce tangible 
results.33 
 
 Finally, let me emphasise that genuine commitment 
and substantially increased resources should now  
accompany the transform ation of  our institutions, 
systems, mechanisms, and state of preparedness , and 
the developing  world must not be left behind.  
 
I pray that we have a successful 77th Session of the 
United Nations General Assembly.", GMB,2022

The General  Debate  of the 77th Session  of the  
 United  Nations  General  Assembly  
Thursda y, 22nd September  2022 
 
 
 
 
 
(Check  against  delivery)Mr. President,  
Fellow Leaders,  
Mr Secretary General,  
Excellencies,  
Distinguished Delegates,  
      
Let me begin by praising and thanking the Almighty God for His everlasting love, 
peace, mercy and blessings upon the world and each one of us here today.  In his 
holy name, “Kam naba bane ni Mauri”.   
Mr President, I join previous speakers in congratulating you and the Government of 
Hungary for your election as President of the General Assembly.   Mr. President 
please be assured of Kiribati’s full support and cooperation as you steer the helm of 
this august body to make the 77th session a watershed moment for the many 
interlocking challenges facing humanity.   
In the same token, I congratulate and thank our outgoing President of the Maldives 
for a resoundingly successful 76th session as demonstrated in the accomplishment 
of his many new initiatives.   He has infused a renewed sense of faith and hope in 
the power of a united humanity and a stronger multilateralism.  The most remarkable 
legacy of h is leadership has been for the inclusion of under -represented member 
states within the workings of the United Nations.   Never before have the small island 
developing states been diversely and widely represented within the realms of the 
Office of the Presi dent of the General Assembly.  
To the Secretary -General of the United Nations – thank you for your stellar and 
steady leadership especially during these very difficult and trying times.   Kiribati 
welcomes and fully endorses your re -appointment for a second  term to further 
advance and complete a comprehensive overhaul of the United Nations in meeting 
its obligations for the peoples it serves.We also appreciate the restructuring of the multi -country offices aimed at bringing 
the UN closer to the people on t he ground.   The establishment of the UN’s multi -
country office (MCO) for the Northern Pacific region which includes Kiribati is a 
symbolic notion of bringing the UN closer for effective and tailored delivery of UN 
services. We hope to see more tangible de velopmental activities occurring in this 
remote and underrepresented region of the United Nations.  
I wish to also acknowledge the great contributions and services that the UN agencies 
have delivered to my country and people.  In particular, I would like to  convey a big 
“Thank You” to the UN Police for all the assistance and support that has enabled our 
Kiribati police to participate for the first time in the UN peacekeeping missions 
starting with UNIMISS in South Sudan.  
WORLD LEADERS TO SAVE HUMANITY FROM T HE SCOURGE OF 
WAR, PROMOTE HUMAN DIGNITY AND RIGHTS  AND BETTER 
STANDARDS OF LIVING.  
Mr President,  
Seventy six years ago, in establishing the United Nations Charter, our founding 
fathers committed to cooperate to prevent future wars and eliminate root cause s of 
wars and other violent conflicts in society.  They agreed to restore the godliness, 
dignity and worth of the human person and improve the standard of living for all, to 
name a few.  Today, we take stock of the progress made towards those goals along 
with new commitments and to reflect and assess if we have truly lived up those 
values.                      
KIRIBATI’S MEMBERSHIP AND ATTENDANCE TO UNGA  
Mr. President,   
As a Small Island Developing Nation, multilateralism is central to the sustainable 
devel opment of Kiribati. It offers a variety of opportunities to engage on global 
issues that are of importance to the wellbeing of our people.  With an ocean arealarge enough to fit the whole of Europe, our Kiribati Vision for 20 years and foreign 
policy obje ctives has been on the promotion of ocean health and wealth. This 
includes both the risks from nuclear submersibles traversing our waters and the 
damaging effects of Illegal Unregulated and Unreported activities on our fisheries. 
Most importantly, is the h ealth of our people especially those who were exposed to 
the nuclear test blasts on Christmas Island.        
We are grateful for the leading role together with Kazakhstan on Articles 6 and 7 of 
the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) concer ning assistance 
for persons and environments harmed by nuclear testing.  Two of the initiatives, that 
we proposed, are now reflected in the Vienna Programme of Action Plan.  The first 
is the establishment of a voluntary trust fund to assist countries, comm unities and 
people and environments harmed by nuclear testing. Second, is a creation of a 
Scientific Advisory Body to help provide the Science needed to address health and 
environmental problems occasioned by past nuclear testing.  We are grateful to those  
countries that have already pledged support and made contributions for these 
initiatives and especially those who are not yet states parties to the Treaty on the 
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  
Let me be clear - humanity should be free now and forever fr om the tests and use of 
nuclear weapons. This is why my government has decided to invite the United 
Nations to use Kiritimati Island as a global or sub -global centre for anti -nuclear 
researches and related programmes and activities.  
 
THEME OF THE 77TH SESS ION OF THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
Mr President,  
The choice of theme for this 77th session cannot be more appropriate and timely.  A 
cloud of uncertainty and fear continues to cast over humanity in light of the two -year 
long COVID -19 pandemic. Communities, fam ilies and businesses are still reelingfrom the effects of the pandemic.  Compounding these devastations are the persisting 
challenges of climate change that manifested in coastal erosion reducing available 
land space and droughts that affected livelihoods  of many persons.               
The Ukraine war has added to the despair and uncertainty through the unnecessary 
loss of lives, scarcity of food grains, increase in food and fuel prices and many more.   
The consequences of COVID -19, Climate Change and the war in Ukraine are clear 
examples of interlocking challenges that must be addressed urgently using the 77th 
session’s motto of solidarity, sustainability and science.  Solidarity underscores the 
sustainability of science and its advances.  We saw this thro ugh the record -breaking 
production of vaccines which has saved millions of lives.  By emulating the success 
of sharing vaccine production, of sharing science discoveries, we can ensure many 
more receive lifesaving vaccines and medicines.  On this note, I w ould like to take 
the opportunity to thank all those who have assisted the people of Kiribati in many 
ways through vaccines, financial support and others during the COVID -19 
pandemic.  
Climate change is another area in which science has and continues to mak e advances 
in the science of understanding the root causes and ways to address climate change.  
However, the lack of solidarity even through multilateralism continues to be the 
stumbling block to address the global climate change emergency.  The targets th at 
have been agreed and set under the Paris agreement including the financial pledges 
continue to remain out of reach.  
Mr. President,  
These challenges and the many others that have caused much human suffering in the 
past 7 decades all have but one thing in common.  They are curated by people in 
positions of power and influence.  Much of these irresponsible, selfish, and heartless 
behavio r are part of what the late Queen Elizabeth II referred to as the darker side of 
human nature.  This darker side harbors negative mindsets and attitudes that give into greed, hate and the many other vices that breed more bad than good, resulting in 
confli ct, violence across societies and the world at large.  
Broken humanity cannot be fixed by wonderful speeches, meetings, resolutions, nor 
international instruments, but an interplay of greater compassion and solidarity.  
Sadly, Mr President, harmful mindsets  persist and we ourselves being a remote 
country, are far from being immune from such. The escalating geostrategic 
competition in our part of the world means that regionalism and solidarity are at risk 
of being increasingly used to serve specific national interests, rather than a collective 
of diverse needs and views working in unison for our common benefit.  
As it is the case now, any differing views and sovereign decision that deviates is at 
risk of being vigorously scrutinized and labelled a foe, through a security lens rather 
than a genuine desire to pursue sustainable development for the country and its 
people.  Likewise, efforts undertaken by Kiribati to prepare for its graduation from 
the Least Developed Country status as recommended by the UN are scru tinized.  
With limited resources, we are committed to drive our developmental agenda and 
ensure sustainability when we graduate by maximizing benefits from the Phoenix 
Islands Protected Area and many others.    
Our developmental agenda are grounded on our culture, traditional values and 
norms, practices and aspirations for the benefit of our people.  Yet, they continue 
to be oppressed by  neo-colonial thinking that does not take into account our needs, 
our priorities, and our national context.   A system of “global thinking” that remains 
steeped with legacies of environmental destruction which our peoples have now 
inherited, as in the case of the mining of Banaba Island. We must work together to 
ensure that the solutions and actions to correct these legacies and local watershed 
moments work hand in hand with actions and solutions for today’s interlocking 
challenges.Wendell Berry pointed out that “global thinking” is often merely a euphemism for 
abstract anxieties or passions that are useless for engaged effor ts to save actual 
landscapes.   Multilateralism should never be viewed as a ‘one size fits all’ scenario. 
We are reminded that it is best to orient our work through  locally grounded planning 
and action that focuses on the actual  scaled down watersheds  commonly addressed.  
 
77th Session is to be the watershed moment  
Mr President,  
We have a duty as leaders entrusted with the power to decide, and as enablers of 
solutions for the security, peace and wellbeing of our people that is sustained through 
educatio n, awareness  and financing .  Acting together side by side in unison and 
solidarity, making decisions and taking actions based on reality, and facts derived 
from natural law and true science is a precursor for the transformative solutions we 
need.  
Let us a ll agree to make this 77th Session a watershed moment.  A moment for 
renewed and positive mindsets; a moment for true disciple ship action and a moment 
for a prosperous, peaceful and secure world for all.  I believe that together in unison 
and solidarity a s one human family, and with Gods blessings, we can do it.  
I conclude  by sharing  our traditional  blessings  Te Mauri,  Te Raoi  ao Te Tabomoa  on 
us all.

77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  
  September 2022  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Honorable Heads of State and Government,  
 
Mr. Secretary -General,    
 
Ladies and gentlemen,  
 
I would like to warmly co ngratulate Mr. Csaba Körösi from Hungary, for his 
election as President of the 77th Session of the United Nations General 
Assembly.  
 
I would also like to congratulate Secretary -General António Guterres for his 
commitment to world peace and Mr. Abdula Shahi d from the Maldives for the 
results that he achieved during his term.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Much has been said by the eminent speakers who were before me on this 
podium, which allows me to avoid certain repetitions.  
 
The time has come for us to think of a globa l and lasting Solution, based on 
Solidarity, Sustainability, and Science, as the theme of this Session calls us to do. 
Because the solution to many of our problems is in joint reflection, global 
solidarity, and the pursuit of concerted and collective actio ns. 
 
The COVID -19 pandemic tragically reminded us that we live in a globalized 
world, that the lives of all human beings have equal value, that humanity is one, 
and that we have a common destiny. We must share scientific knowledge and 
ensure equitable acce ss to vaccines.  
Mr. President,  
 
During the last 2 years, we were able to create greater political stability in our 
country, reaffirm our role in the African continent, and reclaim our place in the 
concert of nations.  
 
However, the international contex t does not favor a full implementation of our 
development plan, particularly with respect to the achievement of the 
Sustainable Development Goals.  
 
In Africa, we are also feeling the consequences of the war in Ukraine, whose 
impact is unfortunately broad, particularly in the energy and agricultural 
sectors.  
 
Inflation and increased prices of grains and other staples have considerably 
worsened a food situation that was already challenging.    
 
Guinea -Bissau is a coastal country with a great number of islands.  We have 
dedicated much effort to Mitigation and Adaptation. We hope that COP27 will 
be a deciding step toward defining and adopting concrete strategies to minimize 
the negative impacts of climate changes.  
 
 
Mr. President,  
 
Allow me, as Chairman of the Aut hority of the ECOWAS Heads of State and 
Government, to remind you that our sub -region faces great security challenges 
and that we need peace in order to ensure the development and well -being of 
our people, who are our primary wealth.  
 
The stability of a la rge part of our continent in general, and of West Africa in 
particular, is threatened by insecurity caused by terrorism, violent extremism, 
and transnational crime, which violate the principles of the rule of law and 
democracy.  
 
ECOWAS created a political and legal framework, and structural mechanisms to 
prevent and resolve political and institutional crises. However, the challenges 
continue to be numerous and difficult to overcome.  
We need international assistance to stop the advance of terrorism in West 
Africa and in the entire Sahel region.  
This is a threat to international peace and security, and, in order to combat it 
effectively, we must necessarily involve the entire international community and 
the UN in particular.  
 
 
Mr. President,  
 
I was recently c hosen to chair the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, ALMA.  
 
According to WHO data, 96% of malaria cases globally and 98% of malaria 
deaths occur in Africa. Our continent has not achieved the established goal of 
reducing malaria incidence and mortality by 4 0% by 2020, which is a 
fundamental step in eliminating malaria in the African continent by 2030.  
 
Therefore, more than ever, we need to adopt appropriate measures to protect 
all, everywhere, from infectious diseases. I would like to take this opportunity t o 
call on all countries, governments, donors, and development partners to 
contribute to the Replenishment of the Global Fund. Together, and in solidarity, 
we can end malaria once and for all, and save millions of human lives.  
 
 
Mr. President,  
 
Speaking of solidarity among States and peoples, we cannot forget to mention 
Cuba and the need for this American embargo against our fellow nation to be 
immediately lifted.  
 
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that Guinea -Bissau, despite being a 
small country wit h limited means,  will not spare any efforts in order to 
contribute to maintaining peace, stability, and security on our planet.  
 
We are resolute in continuing to actively participate in the consolidation of 
multilateralism and the promotion of dialogue and  cooperation among the 
nations and peoples of the world.  
Thank you very much.", GNB,2022

His Excellency Mr. António Guterres,  
Secretary -General of the United Nations  
 
Excellencies,  Heads o f State and Government;  
 
Distinguished Delegates;  
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:  
 
I am honored to address this 77th Session of the United Nations 
General Assembly on behalf of the Government and People of 
Liberia .   
 
Let me congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Ko rösi on his 
election as President of this 77th Session of the United Nations 
General Assembly, and assure him of Liberia’s fullest support .  
 
I would also like to commend your predecessor , His Excellency  
Mr. Abdulla Shahid , for a job well done  in administe ring the 
affairs of the 76th Session of the General Assembly .2 
 
 
Let me also extend my profound thanks and appreciation to His 
Excellency Mr. António Guterres , Secretary -General of the United 
Nations , for his  remarkable and visionary leadership .  
 
This y ear's Assembly is taking place at a difficult time when, even 
as the world is recovering from the scourge of COVID -19, we 
continue to face the challenges of the war in Ukraine, climate 
change and its devastating effects on our environment .   
 
Just as the U krainian people are enduring the harsh impact of this 
unwarranted military incursion , the rest of the world is feeling the 
harsh consequences of economic downturn caused by disruptions 
in global supply chains , food insecurity , and rising prices of basic 
goods and services .  
 
The theme of this year's Assembly , ""A Watershed Moment: 
Transformative Solutions to Interlocking Challenges"" , is both 
appropriate and meaningful . It not only  reminds us about the 
current state of our world, and provides us the space to  reflect on 
the multiple  challenges that confront us today .3 
 
 
They  include  the health and socio -economic impacts of the 
COVID -19 pandemic , the devasta ting effects of climate change , 
environmental concerns , poverty reduction , food insecurity , and 
gender in equality .   
 
The challenges confronting the world today will require immediate 
collective global actions with the United Nations at the cent er of 
the search for solutions. In so doing , we must give special 
consideration to the needs of developing countries , particularly , 
the Least Developed Countries ; in line with the Doha Program of 
Action for Least Developed Countries for the Decade ; 2022 -2031 .  
  
Working together with the United Nations family , Liberia hereby 
commits to protect our planet , to promote pea ce, prevent 
conflicts , to ensure sustainable financing , and to boost 
partnerships .4 
 
 
MR. PRESIDENT, EXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED LADIES 
AND GENTLEMEN:  
 
This commitment is reflected  in the Pro -Poor Agenda for 
Prosperity and Development which embodies  the expression of 
our shared determination to achieve peace , prosperity , national 
development ; address extreme poverty , inequalities , regional 
disparities , infrastructure deficits , climate change , and equitable 
distribution of our national wealth . 
 
Given Liberia ’s youthful population  of more than sixt y (60%) 
percent , my Government initiated a youth rehabilitation and 
empowerment program - the Socio -Economic Empowerment of 
Disadvantaged Youth Project between 2019 and 2021 , with the  
subsequent launch of a 13-Million United States Dollars National 
Fund Drive for the rehabilitation and empowerment of at -risk 
youth in Liberia . We remain of the firm conviction  that, when 
empowered, our youth can be a positive force for good.5 
 
 
As Liberia’s Feminist -in-Chief , women empowerment and the 
promotion of gender equality remain key priorities of my 
Government . Women do not only comprise almost half of our 
country's population , but they also play important roles at all 
levels of our society , and must be given equally d eserved 
attention , support , and a place at the leadership and governance 
tables in our society . 
  
To this end , we have developed the legal framework ; including 
the ratification  of regional and international instruments to address 
gender inequalities  which are being carried out  as a result of  
socio -cultural perceptions, practices, and stereotypes that support 
male dominance and the subordination of women . 
 
I would like to inform you that my  Government , together with UN 
partners , is implementing the EU Spotli ght Initiative to end 
violence and harmful traditional practices against women and 
girls, and promote their sexual and reproductive health and rights . 
 
Furthermore , the Government of Liberia is currently implementing 
a 50-Million United States Dollars ECOW AS-funded project to 
enhance the capacity of female entrepreneurs .6 
 
 
MR. PRESIDENT : 
 
I wish to express Liberia’s sincere gratitude to our local and 
international partners , both multilateral and bilateral , for their 
continued support to our national effort s in combating the 
pandemic .  
 
As a result of that support, Liberia is well on its way to achieving 
herd immunity  hopefully by the end of this year with sixty -seven 
(6%) percent of the population already  fully vaccinated .  
 
DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES, LADIES  AND GENTLEMEN:  
 
My Government continues to take actions through the formulation 
of new policy frameworks and  strategic interventions to address 
the impacts of climate change and protect the environment . 
Liberia commits to achieving  a target of sixty -four (64%) percent 
reduction in carbon emission below business -as-usual by 2030 . 
  
We anticipate that the  United Nations Climate Change 
Conference in Egypt  (COP 27), will provide the opportunity to 
accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and 
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change .7 
 
 
MR. PRESIDENT, EXCELLENCIES : 
 
Sustainable development can take place only in a peaceful and 
secure environment . In fulfillment of our commitment to the 
maintenance of regional and global peace and security , Liberia 
takes pride as a troop -contributing country , with Liberian troops 
and other security apparatus serving in the United Nations 
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali 
(MINUSMA ), the United Nations Mission in South Sudan 
(UNMISS ), and the United Nations Interim Security Forces for 
Abyei (UNISFA ). 
 
We thank the United Nations and our bilateral and multilateral 
partners for the support we continue to receive in facilitating our 
contribution to global and regional peace and security  
    
MR. PRESIDENT, EXCEL LENCIES : 
 
I am pleased to report that the IMF’s latest appraisal of the 
ongoing program it has with Liberia is very positive . It shows that 
inflation rates have been significantly reduced. T here are now 
better prospects for economic gr owth compared  to previous years 
- in spite of the negative effects of Covid -19.8 
 
 
Our efforts at instituting new policy measures to fight graft were 
also particularly commended in the report , along with our 
adherence to prudent fiscal management . 
 
MR. PR ESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN:  
 
Democracy in Liberia also continues to grow from strength to 
strength . After many years of civil upheaval , Liberia is becoming a 
stronghold of peace and a safe haven for democracy .   
 
This is because we have ta ken actions in the last few years to 
build and strengthen democratic institutions , such as the press 
and the Liberian Judiciary . 
 
We have put forward new legislation that empower the media, 
while eradicating those that have tended to suppress  free speech .  
I am proud to say that, from the beginning of my Administration to 
date, there is no p olitical prisoner in Liberia.9 
 
 
At regional conferences of the Mano River Union and ECOWAS , 
which have been called to discuss  efforts to restore democracy in 
a few trouble spots in our West African region , Liberia has 
constantly and co nsistently pleaded for a strict adherence to 
constitutional term limits , and for a return to democratic civil ian 
rule in cases of military takeovers . 
 
Liberia is  expected to hold Presid ential and Legislative elections 
in October 2023 . The forthcoming elections will be crucial to 
consolidating our democracy.  
 
In this regard , I wish to underscore my Government's unwavering 
commitment to ensuring that the enabling environment continues 
to exists for the conduct of peaceful , free, fair, transparent , and 
inclusive elections .  This is in keeping with my commitment to 
ensure that the democratic will of the Liberian people is respected 
at all times .10 
 
 
In the run -up to the 2023 elections , it is incumbent upon all 
prospective candidates to avoid the incitement of violence , and 
any other behavior that could deprive the Liberian people of the 
peaceful space that they need to freely exercise their franchise , 
and freely express their political will  in choosing their leaders .  
We must let the people decide , and then we must respect their 
decision .  That is indeed the true essence of democracy . 
 
Meanwhile, we will continue to count on the United Nations , and 
our various bilateral and multilateral part ners, for financial , 
technical , and institutional capacity -building support .  
 
 
MR. PRESIDE NT, EXCELLENCIES : 
 
If we must advance the common good of humanity , the 
implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the attainment of the 
Sustainable Development Goals , then international cooperation 
must be given primacy , and the principle of solidarity must have 
its rightful place .11 
 
 
We have the platform to generate  the transformative solutions we 
seek . The world is watching , our people are watching ; and we 
must now sei ze the moment ; confront the challenges and 
collectively endeavor to lift the poor from poverty and hunger , 
sickness and disease , and ensure progress , development and 
prosperity for all .   
 
At the same time, we must protect our planet, guarantee and 
maintai n global peace , security , and stability . 
 
Mr. President , we must  pursue efforts to make the United 
Nations more  efficient , more  effective , more  inclusive , more  
accountable , and more  suited for the purpose .  
 
I thank you.", LBR,2022
 SOM_77_2022,"  Your Excellency, Csaba Korosi, President of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Excellencies, Heads of States and Governments, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentleman,  All protocols observed,  It is a great honour and privilege to address the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly here in New York today.   At this particularly challenging time in human history, I welcome the important theme of this Session which directs us all to find transformative joint solutions to the various interlocking challenges we face. There is absolutely no doubt that today, we as a community of nations, collectively face the most challenging socio-economic and environmental situation we have experienced in modern history. In fact, I can say with sadness, that the situation is dire and, potentially, existential.  Therefore, without transformative and urgent implementable solutions to these interlocking challenges of our time, the small window of opportunity we have to act together will pass to the detriment of all our citizens and the world. Our actions today will surely determine our fate and that of the generations to come. The burden on all our shoulders is heavy and failure is not an option.   Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  Most of the World is still recovering from the devastating health and socio-economic impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic. This  pandemic was unprecedented in its impact on the daily lives of all citizens across the world in that it changed the way we live forever and clearly presented how unprepared the world is for such shocks and disruptions. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic painfully illustrated how far apart the world is in development and ability to respond to such huge crises through the top-down distributions of the vaccines with richer nations being able to invest in and distribute lifesaving vaccines more rapidly for their citizens while developing countries like Somalia waited for whatever was available and they could afford or were gifted by international partners. While this vaccine inequality is symbolic of the existing developmental divide between the developed and developing world, we as a community of nations understood that we must, and can, stand together to overcome even the greatest of challenges if we have strong global systems of cooperation, collaboration, and action. In this regard, the Somali Federal Government is grateful to all its dedicated medical professionals on the COVID-19 frontline and bilateral and multilateral partners who supported our national efforts to vaccinate our people and provide protection for their livelihoods through the difficult COVID-19 crises. Today, we must ensure the global inequality of the COVID-19 vaccines is not replicated with the looming food security crises.  Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,   Our World is becoming less secure through recurring conflict, increasing international terrorism, and the destructive impact of  climate change. I cannot prioritize between these three interlocking challenges because they are equally as dangerous and directly hamper any progress we can make anywhere in the world on achieving the vital UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. In fact, these complex and interconnected crises are the drivers of today’s unprecedented international humanitarian crises, food insecurity, rapid urbanization and the burdensome international cost of living crises which is pushing most of the world’s population into poverty. Indeed, we are at an unbearable juncture in human history where citizens are looking to their respective governments and international multilateral systems to provide meaningful policy responses which are anchored on transformative and sustainable solutions. Accordingly, we, as a community of nations, must be more optimistic and work even more closely together rather than retreat to nationalistic isolation which does not, and cannot, serve our global citizenry in this new age of interconnectivity and interdependence.  In Somalia, we are working tirelessly to transition from over two decades of devastating conflict, droughts, famine, and developmental stagnation to a new age of stability and progress. However, despite our continuing efforts, Somalia and its resilient people are facing some of the most complex and interconnected crises in the World. These crises include the ongoing regional droughts which is directly threatening the lives and livelihoods of Somalia’s most vulnerable communities. In fact, our government has called on all its business community, diaspora, and  international partners to work with us to do everything possible to avert a possible looming famine. We urge all our partners to heed our call and work with us to provide immediate support and relief to the most affected communities.  In the long term, we must collectively work together to ensure that we mitigate the acceleration of the dangerous and costly climate crises through meeting the commitments to invest in, and adequately finance, climate adaptation in the most affected and vulnerable regions including most of Sub-Saharan Africa. Key areas of investment must be sustainable water management, biodiversity protection to enhance food security, climate smart agriculture, resilient infrastructure, and more investment in renewable energy.  In Somalia, for the first time, we have established a new Ministry of Environment and Climate Change to lead on the urgent process of addressing the devastating impact of our national and regional environmental deterioration.  Somalia is caught between floods and droughts annually owing to climate change and poor infrastructure. Our people who have a long tradition of living harmoniously with nature, and barely contributing to the poisonous emissions warming the earth, are the ones paying with their lives. We are, therefore, taking the matter of protecting our environment seriously because we know climate change is real as we are living with the evidence of its painful and destructive reality. We also know that Somalia, and the  rest of the world, cannot develop sustainably without the global climate crises being jointly addressed quickly and effectively because our whole way of life and the most important job creating productive sectors of our economy including agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and the wider blue economy depend on it.  Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,   Terrorists are making our world less safe by the day. Terrorism remains a persistent and complex challenge which both contributes to and exacerbates all other crises including food insecurity, displacement of people from their homes and climate change. Terrorists have no religion or human values: they are violent criminals who seek to simply terrorize innocent people. We must continue to stand up to them with all our collective strength.  Nowhere in the world has there been an example of terrorist organizations succeeding against united governments and people let alone govern justly as many falsely claim. The most important lesson we have learnt in the long modern war against international terrorists and terrorism is that neither can be contained or degraded: they need to be comprehensively defeated.  In Somalia, we are actively fighting the terrorist groups called Al-Shabaab who are an Al-Qaeda affiliate and ISIS. Both are criminally misrepresenting the beautiful and peaceful Islamic religion to destabilize the region and, in the process, terrorize the Somali people and their brothers and sisters in neighbouring countries and across the world. In recent weeks, the unprovoked violent and  senseless actions of Al-Shabaab against innocent civilians across Somalia has highlighted the urgent need for an expedited common national and international response to defeating them on a permanent basis to advance regional and global security. At the height of the humanitarian crises, this group which falsely claims to be Islamic, blew up desperately needed water wells, burnt transport carrying food and killed innocent people who were already struggling to live because of the impact of the severe drought. This is the true criminal and despicable face and intentions of terrorism and terrorists.  On our part, the Somali Federal Government, and its Federal Member states, with the direct support of our brave and resilient people, are responding by challenging and defeating the terrorist group in major localities in which they still remain.  The Somali people have begun to organically rise-up in support of their government’s call to defend themselves and their nation from the evils of terror. As recently as this past month, more towns and villages were recovered through our offensive military operations with the support of the local communities. We are now confident that, with enhanced public support, our government will eliminate terrorism from Somalia because the Somali people have finally realized that Al-Shabaab’s repressive actions will not end until we all take action to achieve this. In a nutshell, the Somali people now believe Al-Shabaab can and will be defeated and this is our real source of energy and inspiration as a government in the fight against international terrorism.  At the policy level, the Somali government will continue to work with all its partners, including the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia, in the fight against global terrorism. We are truly committed to doing the heavy lifting to secure our future. However, to deliver the killer blow to the violence and insecurity, we must think past the notions of Containing and Degrading Al-Shabaab or any other terrorist organization anywhere in the world. We know these policies are no longer as effective as they were once thought to be at this advanced stage in the fight against the ever-evolving global terrorism threat.  Instead, we need to focus all our joint efforts on the Somali government’s new strategy of militarily, ideologically, and financially challenging terrorism and terrorists to ensure that they are comprehensively defeated once and for all, and quickly. Furthermore, the Somali government is sincerely committed to working with all its partners to effectively train, equip and sustain its armed forces with the view to going forward to fully transition security responsibilities in the future. We understand that this is the only long-term sustainable solution for stability and progress in our country, the region and world.    Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,   Without predictable and committed national and international financing, it is not possible to realize transformative solutions to the interlocking challenges we face. In Somalia, we are working to enhance our economic capacity through a rigorous economic and financial reform program. This will strengthen Somalia’s economic fundamentals, improve Public Financial Management, and  mobilize more urgently needed domestic resources to respond to crises more sustainably and swiftly. However, given Somalia’s fragile economic situation as a recovering post conflict state, financing global development priorities must be underpinned by a common international commitment to support countries like ours with more concessionary financing, capacity building and investment in all areas that can strengthen resilience to today’s multiple crises including climate change, security, and the provision of social protection for the most vulnerable in our societies. We must also facilitate and promote private sector investment and participation in overcoming these challenges to transition from simply what is now referred to as Corporate Social Responsibility to Common Societal Prosperity in which we all contribute our fair share.  Conclusion In conclusion, there is no escaping the global vicious cycle of complex and interconnected crises which challenges our citizens and the wider world. More worryingly, they have become repetitive and without strong bilateral, multilateral, civil society, and private sector partnership, they cannot be addressed effectively anywhere or by any single nation or geographic region alone. In the absence of urgent and effective joint action starting today, the dream of achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 will remain just that: a mere distant dream.  On our part, the Somali government is committed and determined to defeat international terrorism with all our international partners, tackle extreme poverty, raise the environmental consciousness of our population, mitigate the worst of the climate change impact, and rebuild an inclusive, resilient, and people-centered society and economy through our successful ongoing socio-economic reform programs. These are the basis for the transformative solutions that will help us mitigate and overcome the interlocking challenges that our nation faces today and pave the way for a future of progress and prosperity.  The most important lessons we learnt from dealing with the multiple, complex, and interconnected crises in Somalia is that we must not always be behind and plan for, and respond to, the worst cases of emergencies when we have many early national and international warning systems in place. It is better, and more just and prudent, to plan ahead and focus on building resilience by finding and financing durable solutions that help to deliver sustainable development for the most vulnerable across the world.  In Somalia we have a wise saying and it is: One finger cannot wash a whole face. If we work together sincerely and collaboratively as a community of nations, no challenge, no matter how big, is insurmountable.  I thank you all.", SOM,2022
 ISR_77_2022,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
In November 1947 this General Assembly gathered and decided upon the 
creation of a Jewish State. Only a few hundred thousand Jews lived in Israel at 
the time, in hostile surroundings, shocked and devastated after the Holocaust in which six million of our people were murdered.  
 75 years later, Israel is a strong liberal democracy. Proud and prosperous. The 
Start-Up Nation that invented Waze and Iron Dome, Medicines for Alzheimers 
and Par kinsons and a robot which can perform spinal surgery. A world leader in 
water and food-tech, cyber defense and renewable energy. With 13 Nobel prize winners in literature and chemistry, economics and peace.  
  
How did this happen?  
 
It happened because we d ecided not to be a victim.  
 
We chose not to dwell on the pain of the past.  
But rather to focus on the hope of the future.  
We chose to invest our energies into building a nation.  
Into building a happy society, optimistic and creative.  
 
We didn’t only reach the Promised Land, we are building the Promised Land.  
 
History is determined by people. We need to understand history, respect it and 
learn from it.  
But also to be willing and able to change it.  
To choose the future over the past.  
Peace over war.  
Partne rship over seclusion and isolation.  
 
A few months ago we convened the historic Negev Summit.  
We sat at dinner, not far from the grave of David Ben Gurion, the founding father of the State of Israel.  
There were six of us.  
The Secretary of State of the Un ited States, Foreign Ministers of Egypt, the 
United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Israel.  
A dinner that only two years ago no-one would have believed was possible.  
 
And then the door opened, someone came in and said, ""I'm sorry to disturb you, 
but there was a terror attack not far from Tel Aviv. Two Israelis were murdered.""  
In an instant we all understood that the goal of the attack was to destroy the 
summit.To create anger among us, to cause us to argue and to divide this new 
partnership between u s. 
 
I said to the Foreign Ministers, ""We have to condemn this terror attack, right now, 
together. We have to show the world that terror will not triumph.""  
 
The room fell silent.  
And then one of the Arab Foreign Ministers said, ""We are always against terro r, 
that's why we are here.""  
And five minutes later we put out a joint statement from the six of us condemning the attack and sanctifying life, cooperation and our belief that there is a different 
way. 
 
The summit continued.  
Agreements were signed.  
Working groups were formed to deal with issues of technology, food security, 
energy, water, education and infrastructure.  Those working groups are changing the face of the Middle East as we speak.  
 The people of the Middle East, the people of the entire world, s hould look around 
and ask themselves:  
Who is doing better?  
Those who chose the path of peace, or those who chose the way of war?  
Those who chose to invest in their people and country, or those who chose to 
invest in the destruction of others?  
Those who believe in education, tolerance and technology, or those who believe 
in bigotry and violence?  
 Whenever I meet someone who has criticism of Israel, I always have the same 
answer:  
Come and visit us.  
Come and meet the real Israel. You will fall in love.  
A country which combines breathtaking innovation with a deep sense of history.  
Great people, great food, Great spirit.  
A vibrant democracy.  
A country in which Jews, Muslims and Christians live together with full civic 
equality.  
 In the government which I l ead, there are Arab Ministers.  
There is an Arab party as a member of our coalition.  
We have Arab judges in our Supreme Court.  
Arab doctors saving lives in our hospitals.  
Israeli Arabs are not our enemies, they are our partners in life.Come and visit us.  
You will discover that Israel is an incredible, cultural mosaic.  
From the white snowy mountains of the Golan to the white desert sand of the 
Negev.  
From Tel Aviv, the high-tech capital, a non -stop party on the Mediterranean Sea.  
To Jerusalem, our eternal capital, the holy city for three religions, in whose beautiful streets the past meets the future every single day.  
  
--  
 
There are however two major threats hanging over the head of our wonderful 
country.  
They also hang over your heads, even though yo u may try to deny them. The 
first is the nuclear threat. The fear that terrorist states and terrorist organizations 
will get their hands on nuclear weapons. The second threat is the demise of truth.  
 
Our democracies are slowly being poisoned by lies and fa ke news. Reckless 
politicians, totalitarian states and radical organizations are undermining our perception of reality.  
 We should know, there is no country in the world that faces this phenomenon 
more than Israel. There is no country that has come under a greater attack of 
lies, with such a vast amount of money and effort being invested in spreading 
disinformation about it.  
 
Last May, the picture of Malak al-Tanani, a Three -year-old Palestinian girl, was 
published all over the world, with the terrible news  that she was killed with her 
parents in an attack by the Israeli Air Force.  It was a heartbreaking image, but Malak Al Tanani doesn’t exist. The photo was 
taken from Instagram.  
It is of a girl from Russia.  
 
I can give you thousands more examples of simi lar fake news about Israel. The 
anti-Israel movement has been spreading these lies for years. In the media, on 
college campuses and on social media. The question is not why they do it, but 
why are you willing to listen.  
 
Why are you listening to people who  have invested billions of dollars in distorting 
the truth?  
Why do you side with Islamic extremists who hang gay people from cranes, oppress women, and fire rockets at civilians from kindergartens and hospitals?I am not a guest in this building.  
Israe l is a proud sovereign nation, and an equal member of the United Nations.  
We will not be silent when those who wish to harm us, use this very stage to 
spread lies about us.  
 
Antisemitism is the willingness to believe the worst about the Jews, without 
ques tioning.  
Antisemitism is judging Israel by a different standard than any other country.  
-- 
 
Conducting this orchestra of hate, is Iran.  
For more than forty years now, in the town squares and on the streets of Iran, 
demonstrators have been photographed bu rning Israeli and American flags.  
Ask yourselves: Where are the flags coming from? How did they get so many of our flags?  
 
The answer is: They are manufacturing them especially.  
Just so they can burn them.  
This is what an industry of hate looks like.  
This is a regime that systematically deals with hatred.  
 
They even hate their own people.  
Young Iranians are suffering and struggling from the shackles of Iran’s regime, 
and the world is silent.  
They cry for help on social media.  
They pay for their desire to live a life of freedom — with their lives.  
 
 
 
Iran’s regime hates Jews,  
hates women,  
hates gay people,  
hates the West.  
They hate and kill Muslims who think differently, like Salman Rushdie and Mahsa 
Amini.  
Their hate is a way of life.  
It is a way to preserve their oppressive rule.  
There is only one member -state in the UN that openly states its wish to destroy 
another member -state.  
Iran has declared time and time again that it is interested in the ""total destruction"" of the State of Israel.And this building is silent.  
 
What are you afraid of?  
Has there ever been a time in human history where silence stopped violence?  
 The country that wants to destroy us, is also the country that founded the largest 
terrorist organization in the world, Hezboll ah.  
Iran funds Hamas and Islamic Jihad and is behind mass terrorist attacks from 
Bulgaria to Buenos Aires. It is a murderous dictatorship that is making every 
effort to get a nuclear weapon.  
 If the Iranian regime gets a nuclear weapon, they will use it.  
 
The only way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, is to put a credible 
military threat on the table.  
And then – and only then –  to negotiate a Longer and Stronger deal with them.  
It needs to be made clear to Iran, that if it advances its nuclea r program, the 
world will not respond with words, but with military force.  
Every time a threat like that was put on the table in the past, Iran stopped, and retreated.  
 
Today, the world is choosing the easy option.  
It chooses not to believe the worst, de spite all the evidence to the contrary.  
Israel does not have this privilege.  
This time we are not standing empty -handed against those who want to destroy 
us. 
 
The Jews today have a state.  
We have an army.  
We have great friendships,  
first and foremost wit h the United States.  
We have capabilities and we are not afraid to use them.  
We will do whatever it takes:  
Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.  
We will not stand by while there are those who try to kill us. Not again. Never 
Again.  
 
-- 
Israel's economic and military strength allows us to protect ourselves but it also 
allows us something else:  
To strive for peace with the entire Arab world.  
And with our closest neighbors –  the Palestinians.An agreement with the Palestinians, based on two states for two peoples, is the 
right thing for Israel's security, for Israel's economy and for the future of our 
children.  
 Peace is not a compromise.  
It is the most courageous decision we can make.  
Peace is not weakness. It embodies within it the entire might of human spirit.  
War is surrender to all that is bad within us. Peace is the victory of all that is good.  
 Despite all the obstacles, still today a large majority of Israelis support the vision 
of this two state solution. I am one of them.  
 
We have only one condition:  
That a future Palestinian state will be a peaceful one.  
That it will not become another terror base from which to threaten the well -being, 
and the very existence of Israel.  
That we will have the ability to protect the security of all the citizens of Israel, at all times.  
 
If someone believes that demand is too much, then look at the neighbourhood in 
which we live:  
Look at Lebanon, a collapsing state controlled by Hezbollah.  
At Syria, where a murderous regime massacred half a million of its own people.  
Look at Afghanistan.  
At Libya.  
At Iran.  
 
You can ask us to live according to the values in the UN Charter, but you cannot 
ask us to die for them.  
 
My father was a child in the Ghetto, my grandfather was murdered in a 
concentration camp.  
We want to l ive in peace but only if it gives us security, not if it threatens us even 
more.  
 
Look at Gaza.  
Israel did everything the world asked of us, including from this very stage.  
We left.  
17 years ago we dismantled the settlements, took apart our military bases . 
There is not a single Israeli soldier in Gaza.  
We even left them 3,000 green houses so they could start to build an economyfor themselves.  
 
What did they do in response?  
In less than a year, Hamas, a murderous terror organization, came to power.  
They destroyed the greenhouses and replaced them with terrorist training camps and rocket launch sites.  
Since we left Gaza, over 20,000 rockets and missiles have been fired at Israel. All of them at civilians. All of them at our children.  
 I have a child with s pecial needs.  
Her name is Yaeli.  
She is autistic.  
She doesn't speak.  
In May last year I had to wake her at 3 o’clock in the morning and run down with her to the bomb shelter, because missiles were exploding above our home.  
 
All those who preach about the importance of peace, are welcome to try running 
to a bomb shelter at 3am with a girl who does not speak.  
To explain to her, without words, why there are those who want to kill her.  
 
In this building, we've been asked more than once why we do not lift the 
restrictions on Gaza.  
We're ready to do that, tomorrow morning.  
We're ready to do more than that.  
I say from here to the people of Gaza, we're ready to help you build a better life, 
to build an economy.  We presented a comprehensive plan to help rebuil d Gaza.  
We only have one condition:  
Stop firing rockets and missiles at our children.  
 
Put down your weapons, there will be no restrictions.  
Put down your weapons, bring home our children who are being held in captivity – Hadar and Oron, may their memory be a blessing; Avera and Hisham, who are 
still alive – and we will build your economy together.  
We can build your future together, both in Gaza and in the West Bank.  
Put down your weapons and prove that Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not going 
to take over t he Palestinian state you want to create.  
Put down your weapons, and there will be peace.  
 
That is the minimum I owe my grandfather, my father and my daughter.  
 
The Jewish people have learnt the lessons of the past.  
Our security is guaranteed by our military might, our economic ingenuity, ourdemocratic resilience. 
 
Israel seeks peace with our neighbors.  
All our neighbors.  
We are not going anywhere.  
The Middle East is our home.  
We are here to stay. Forever.  
And we call upon every Muslim country — from Saudi Arabia to Indonesia — to 
recognize that, and to come talk to us. Our hand is outstretched for peace.  
 
Conflicts do not disappear on their own.  
Hostility doesn't disappear on its own.  
People create conflicts, people can also replace them with friendship,  kindness 
and common good.  
 The burden of proof is not on us.  
We have already proved our desire for peace.  
Our peace treaty with Egypt has been fully implemented for 43 years now.  
Our peace treaty with Jordan for 28 years.  
We are a country that keeps its word and fulfills agreements.  
 
We proved our desire for peace through the Abraham Accords, the Negev 
Summit, and the agreements we've signed with the Arab world.  
 
In the book of Numbers, there is a verse that every Jew is familiar with:  
""ישא השם פניו  ךאלי  וישם לך שלום
  "".
“May the Lord raise His countenance toward you, and grant you peace.”  
 
The State of Israel is the only country in the world founded by a book. The Book 
of Books. The Tanach.  
That book and the principles of liberal democracy require us to  stretch out our 
hand in peace. Our history requires us to be clear -eyed and very careful.  
 
That is how we've made peace in the past.  
That is how we'll make peace in the future.   Thank you.", ISR,2022

PAPUA NEW GUINEA  
to the  
SEVENTY -SEVENTH  SESSION  
of the  
UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY GENERAL DEBATE  
 
 
 
22 SEPTEMBER 2022 , NEW YORKPage | 1 
 His Excellency, Mr. Csaba Korosi , President  of the General Assembly ; 
 
His Excellency , Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary -General of the United 
Nations ; 
 
Distinguished Fellow Heads of State and Government;  
 
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen;  
 
It is my honour and privilege to, again, join and address this august Hall.  
On my Government and people’s behalf, I congratulate you, Mr 
President, and the Government and people of Hungary, on your 
election to preside over the  new term of the General Assembly ’s work  
and wish you well .  
Mr. President ,  
Your presidency ’s theme of an  integrated agenda for peace, prosperity 
and sustainability through multilateralism  is most needed  today . We 
must build on the good foundations laid by your predecessors  and all of 
us. This is given the turmoil, uncertainty, mistrust, pain and suffering, from 
multiple crisis, including the COVID -19 pandemic, the worsening climate 
crisis, escalating socio -economic challenges, and confli cts tearing us 
apart.  
Let us  transform  words into  actions . This must be underpinned by our 
collective  commitment s; supportive resources that are affordable , 
accessible  and timely ; and with enhanced opportunities , that will assist 
us all, to provide our people’s basic needs, restore their trust and 
confidence in governments, heal our lands and ecosystems to deliver 
the future we want , as envisioned by the 2030 Agenda and many of our 
own development aspirations .Page | 2 
 Mr. President , let me pay tribute to your predecessor, a fellow Small 
Island Developing State representative, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla 
Shahid, of Maldives, for his outstanding “presidency of hope” that has 
renewed our collective resolve to turn the tide against  the ravages of 
the pandemic and other evolving challenges . We wish him well.  
May I also convey my delegation’s gratitude to Mr. Secretary -General , 
for his continued strong leadership and un tiring efforts in rallying the 
world to save ourselves and to provide a future that is much better, safer 
and secure for all, including for succeeding generation s.  
The candid yet sobering report presented by the Secretary -General to 
us at this meeting on the state of our world today, is deeply troub ling.  
The clarion call from the Secretary -General must not go unheeded. We 
must all do our part and act decisively, now, for our collective good . 
Otherwise , the alternative is to  condemn ourselves to a future of doom 
and gloom . Is that what our children  deserve?    
It is with this in mind that Papua New Guinea is supportive of the 
Secretary -General’s narrative of “Our Common Agenda” . We welcome 
the preliminary progress made to better understand the range of 
defining issues  and how we address this effectively  to help deliver on the 
SDGs  promise  to improve our people’s lives a nd livelihoods whilst also 
protect ing common  environment better.   
To this end, we applaud the Secretary -General for convening the 
Transforming Education Summit . We are pleased to note the shared 
recognition of education as the cornerstone for a prosperous, stable 
and secure future for all . I know that an educated society is an informed 
society that stands to make better decisions . 
For my country, education is a key priority and is guided by our 
education policy of “leave no child behind” , supported by our 
Education Sector Development Plan 2023 -2027 . 
It is a holistic  and inclusive  approach in ensuring focus on quality lifelong 
education for all and with special attent ion given to the most vulnerablePage | 3 
 and marginalized population  and recognizing the importance of 
multistakeholder participation .  
A demonstration of this strong commitment for education is my 
Government’s decision to provide free -education for all, up to Gra de 
12 and beyond  and also providing opportunities to children, youth and 
adults through Flexible Open and Distance Education and community 
colleges to upskill their capacity to be entrepreneurs and nation 
builders . 
Mr. President, w e also welcome the consensus reached for the “Summit 
of the Future”, scheduled for September 202 4, to find solutions to the 
multiple crisis we are now facing.  This should , however, be not defined 
by the lowest common  denominator but rather be more ambitious yet 
realistic and  workable . 
 We remain committed to engage in this process, because  it provides 
an opportunity for us to also draw parallels with our national efforts to 
attain our National Vision 2050.   
 Mr. President , I am pleased to inform this Assembly that the COVID -19 
pandemic and other stressors , including supply -chain difficulties and 
development financing challenges, affecting my country has spurred 
my Government to embark on our own similar national process  to the 
Secretary -General’s global efforts under “ Our Common Agenda ”.  
This is where we have taken stock of our own domestic development 
challenges  and we have set in place key polic ies and legislative 
measures, including reforms in important sectors and development 
priorities, and tied to our budget cycle under the Medium -Term 
Development Plan . This path if walked upon would make PNG a mi ddle -
income earn ing nation by 2050 as envisioned by our nation’s Vision 2050.  
 
Mr President , I report to United Nations that the  core focus es of my 
Government for the next 5 years  will be to build a resilient and diversified 
economy, invest in high quality economic and social infrastructure, 
ensure fair and equitable natural resource s development, addressPage | 4 
 business and investment confidences, strengthening the rule of law and 
domest ic security, deliver quality education and health to all and 
strengthening  the Institutions of State including governance.  
These are fundamental building blocks of my country that should 
contribute towards peace, prosperity and sustainable development as 
proposed by yourself, Mr . President.  
Mr. President , as Papua New Guinea  approach es our 50th Independence 
Anniversary in 3 -years time, my Government  is also prioritizing industrializ ing 
our economy  through import -substitution, value -adding and downstream 
processing of our natural resources  with the use of modern clean green 
technology that will n ot compromise  my country ’s rich biodiversity and our 
pristine natural environment , for PNG is documented to have about 5 to 6 
percent  of world ’s biodiversity and our huge tropical rainforest third behind 
Congo and the Amazon areas of our Earth.   
We therefore welcome genuine and appropriate foreign investors to join us 
in partnership in various sectors of our renewable resources development 
and I assure them of a fair, equitable and secure returns  on their 
investments .  
Mr. President , while we note the global community’s calls for domestic 
revenue sources to be expanded and better harnessed for development 
financing, we also recognise that the existing global economic and 
financial architecture is weighed against developing countries like mine.  
This structure  needs to be changed to better support our development 
needs.  Least -we-forget, many times small developing countries get to bear 
the brunt of global economic and social woes that they have no hand in  
engendering . 
In this spirit, I also join the calls from fellow Small Island Developing States  
(SIDS)  for their development financing needs to be considered by taking 
into account their environmental, economic and social dimensions of 
vulnerability rather than the G ross National Income  measure alone, which is 
no longer suitable.  
We therefore urge the international community to support the proposed 
SIDS Multi Vulnerability Index ( MVI)  as a tool to support SIDS concessional 
financing and debt relief given their special circumstances a midst thePage | 5 
 ongoing increasing challenges,  they continue to face for their development 
needs  including food securities that our good Secretary -General allude d to.  
Mr President , today, many parts of the world are facing food insecurity , 
hunger and poverty  and Papua New Guinea can be a country of food 
production . Papua New Guinea ’s 8 million people live in a land mass of four 
hundred and sixty four thousand eight hundred and forty square kilometres 
(464,840 km2) and our country has rain and water abundance with our seas 
equally is food sourc e, like our supply of tuna to Asia and E urope.   
Comparing for instance , United Kingdom of Great Britain’s 24,610 km2 or 
Japan’s 377, 975 km2 or  the Philippines’  300,000 km2, P apua New Guinea  
has enough land, sea and people to be a food supplier to the world , Mr 
Secretary -General in response to your c oncerns for global food security.  
For the first time in our country, my Government has  inserted  efforts to 
address this imminent problem by p lacing more emphasis on the  agriculture 
sector . This is viewed not only as a revenue source for our economy but also 
a conduit to empower the  majority  of our rural communities through 
introduction of innovative farming methods in cash crop production, 
livestock and poultry, to take ownership and leadership of their 
development needs , and livelihoods , and at the same time also foster 
poverty alleviation and food security . 
It is from this perspective that we have established new ministerial portfolios 
for Oil  Palm, Coffee and Livestock , that will assist us cater better not only for 
needs of the majority of our  rural communities and their local economies to 
be integrated into the national and global markets , to improve their lives 
and livelihood  but be the source for food security , and hunger and poverty , 
alleviation for other countries.  
We therefore welcome new international development partners  to work 
with us in the agriculture sector, particularly in the downstream processing 
of products tha t adds value and supports local communities and the 
country . 
 
On climate change, Mr. President , as the world prepares for COP27 and 
despite the rallying efforts of the global community including through the 
pledges under the Paris Agreement to cut emission levels, the world remains 
on fire . This is further compounded by destructive floods and rising  sea levelsPage | 6 
 that continue to inundate and adversely affect coastal communities, 
including displacement and loss of identity  as a people , in my own country  
and across the Pacific region and beyond , as the carbon emission level 
continues its destructive spiral out of control.  We cannot and must not allow 
this to continue.  
I again reiterate my call last year, to this august Hall. My country , as one of 
the largest standing pristine tropical rainfore st of the world , is one of the 
few carbon positive countries in the world.  We remove more carbon 
than we emit.  Over the past 5 years or so, we have reduced national 
forest emissions by 53  percent .  This totals over 7 5 million tonnes  of UN 
verified REDD+ credits that will be on the market by the end of this year.  
My Government has updated our Climate Management Act and this 
year set in place Nationally Determined Contribution  regulation. We 
now have the legislation needed to implement  the Paris Agreement.  
We have also endorsed our Nationally Determined Contributions ( NDC s) 
Implementation Plan and NDC Electricity Roadmap and Agriculture, 
Forestry and other Land  use NDC Roadmap s. We are also drafting our 
first Electric Vehicle Policy an d working towards endorsing our National 
Adaptation Plan .   
It is, however, disheartening to note that despite our proactive national 
efforts to implementing our Paris Agreement commitment, we seem to 
continue to get the raw end of the deal.  We have done our part.  But we 
have had little support from the global north , including for our 
submissions to the Green Climate Fund .  
But we have not lost hope  despite  the fact that REDD+  and Forest 
Nations  were forgotten in Glasgow. We cannot be placated by 
toothless pledges.  We need the power of sovereign carbon markets 
that fully comply with the Paris Agreement.  
The world cannot talk about climate change without talking about 
forest conservations and proper land use managements.Page | 7 
 Papua New Guinea  is calling for an urgent global focus on 
conservation, preservation and sustainability of our global forests with 
proper land use practices because only in our dear trees of the fores ts 
that you find the dual benefit of carbon cleansing and oxygen 
product ion. 
Excellencies,  I was given the privilege of meeting His Majesty King 
Charles The Third , where his views  shared with me  on forest is the same 
as I am mentioning here and that the world, especially those whose 
carbon footprint s over mother earth  is the greatest must help preserve 
forests of earth that commensurate their level s of emissions.  
It is Papua New Guinea’s humble view that the atmospheric balance of 
Oxygen and Carbon should be ranked the number on e focus of all 
mankind because the re-in lies the sustenance of life and the dear trees 
of our forests plays this balanc ing act as created by the Creator God. 
The world must save our forest because not to do so is suicidal for the 
Earth’s future.  
This is something we must correct at COP -27 in Sharm El -Sheikh.  
Let us not forget that there is more carbon stored in the worlds forest 
than held in all known coal, oil and gas reserves.  In short, if we lose our 
rainforest, climate stability is impossible. We may as well k iss the 
temperature goal of  1.5 degrees goodbye.  
We and other rainforest nations are trying our best to balance forest 
harvest for our development needs and conserving for our world. We 
need help here, hear us.   Our planet is fragile. Time is short.  Together, 
we can do this.  
 
On my  final point on climate change, given increasing adverse impact 
of climate change on our communities, I would also like to echo Papua 
New Guinea’s strong support for our Melanesian neighbor, Vanuatu’s 
initiative to seek I nternational Court of Justice  Advis ory Opinion on thisPage | 8 
 existential threat, and welcome others to join the Pacific, Caribbean 
and other partners to take this forward , in this General Assembly, for our 
common good.  
On the ocean agenda, Mr. President,  I would reaffirm that Papua New 
Guinea  as a maritime nation, is strongly committed to ensur ing our 
maritime zones remain  safe, secure  and peaceful , under the spirit of the 
UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).  It not only provides us 
economic opportunities including through our fisheries resources but 
also symbolizes our ties with the ocean.  
Like other S mall Island Developing States and L east Developed 
Countrie s, Papua New Guinea calls on developed nations to assist us 
access appropriate capacity building resources, research, science and 
technology and finance to strengthen our national  efforts to better 
protect our ocean  and harness ocean -based  economy. We therefore 
welcome public -private partnership s.    
On SDG 14 , it was pleasing to note the success of the Second UN Ocean 
Conference . We are also encouraged by the welcome offer by France 
and Costa Rica to be the next co -host of the Conference and look 
forward to working together with likem inded countries to take forward 
this initiative. Such partnerships on the ocean agenda is most 
welcomed.  
Mr. President , I would also  like to applaud the sterling efforts under the 
leadership and presidency of Singapore for last month’s negotiations , 
related to the new implementing instrument on the conservation and 
sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national 
jurisdiction  and as  a marine nation , we offer our full support.  
 
Mr. President , a resounding call we continue to hear, loud and clear , 
and repeatedly, and rightly so, is the importance of empowering youth 
to be at the table of decision -making about their lives and livelihoodsPage | 9 
 and as real partners for national development. This is indeed long 
overdue and must be brought to fruition without further delay.  
In recognition of the ever -increasing youth bulge in the country and the 
challenges they continue to face, u nder my Government’s 
development priorities, youth is now front and center for nation building.  
We are rolling out cadetship program s as a tool for capacity building 
and training that will equip them to be owners, drivers, leaders and 
entrepreneurs to bui ld forward our nation. We are also using our 
education system as a lever to foster integral human development for 
our youth. We welcome development partners to join us in this 
transformative endeavor . 
Mr. President , it is in this spirit that Papua New Guin ea was pleased to be 
a main sponsor and strong supporter of the establishment of a Youth 
Office in the UN Secretariat . It was also pleasing to note the consensus 
on this issue.  
While we recognize that much more work remains to be done, however, 
once opera tionalized, we look forward to harnessing the UN Youth 
Office to support our national efforts on the youth agenda. The potential 
of our youth was well recognized by Her Excellency Amina Mohammed, 
UN Deputy Secretary -General, and the Youth Special Envoy, du ring their 
groundbreaking visit to my country in March 2020.  
Mr. President , on gender equality and empowerment , including 
combating gender -based violence , this remains a top priority for my 
Government.  
 
 
We have established a bipartisan Parliamentary Committee that has 
done extensive public consultations and the recommendations made 
to the last Parliament will be take n up by this Parliament in a serious way ,Page | 10 
 to address better protection of our women and gi rls and give them fair 
and just opportunities to reach their full potential.   
We have also put in place legislation and policies to address concerns 
related to gender equality, empowerment and combat gender -based 
violence.  
Additionally, we are pleased to  have two new well qualified women 
parliamentarians join our 11th Parliament, an improvement from our last 
Parliament, where there were  no women Parliamentarians.  
I have also recognized their capabilities and professionalism and tasked 
them with certain r esponsibilities for the country. We will continue to 
work hard to have more women representatives in decision -making 
bodies, as equal development partners.  
Mr. President, I would like to join the call for global peace and stability. 
The simmering tensions  and mistrust , which are the nemesis of peace, 
cannot and must not be allowed to fester  anymore.  
We as members of this United Nations took it upon ourselves to uphold 
the Charter of the United Nations. It is therefore incumbent on all of us 
to ensure that  we are seen to uphold our commitments to the UN 
Charter.  
In our context of the Bougainville peace process, I want to assure this 
meeting that this important issue remains a top priority for us.  Peace by 
peaceful means underpins this national priority.  
We have a Roadmap that continues to serve as a blueprint and we will 
consider al l issues under the exi sting parameters of our Constitution , for 
a lasting and peaceful political solution that is acceptable to all Papua 
New Guineans.  
We would like to thank United Nations for their role in PNG  and the 
Melanesian conflict resolution model can be replicated in other 
politically conflicted countries.Page | 11 
 On the reforms of the Security Council , Mr. President, to make it relevant 
to today’s realities, we note the i ncremental progress that continues to 
be made in the inter -governmental process.  
However, let me again reiterate our call to expedite the long -drawn -out 
process , by ensuring that we have a negating document that can serve 
as a basis to go forward.  
May I a lso take this opportunity to recognize the mil estone 
achievement , earlier this year, of the General Assembly holdin g the 
members of the Security Council responsible for their decisions 
regarding peace and security.  
We welcomed and supported the Emergency Special Session 
measure s, invoked under the General Assembly with respect to the 
situation in Ukraine and to ensure the Security Council is accountable 
for their actions. The success that arose from this process is a small but 
significant step to why the reform of the Security Council is necessary 
and cannot be  prolonged further.  
In closing, and not the least, Mr. President , may I take this opportunity to 
pay homage to the memory of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The 
Second, who by the grace of God  and Lord Jesus , was PNG’s Head of 
State for 47 years.  Our beloved Queen  personified grace, dignity, 
honesty, humility, tolerance of others, forgive ness and all other Christian 
virtues and lived 70 years of consistent unfailing life of public service , 
some lessons we leaders of the world must learn to practice . 
 
 
I on be half of my Papua New Guinea pay our respects to Mama Kwin 
as we affectionately call her. May her soul rest in peace with her Maker 
Jesus . We share our heartfelt sympathies  and Condolences to  His 
Majesty  King Charles the Third  and h is royal family  and the people and 
the Government of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth family .Page | 12 
 Let me conclude by thanking you Mr President for this speaking 
opportunity on a very appropriate theme contemporary to our shared 
global need and I thank United Nat ions for one more time being a 
wonderful host, in fact a milestone 77th session. May God bless the United 
Nations of our world.  
 I thank you Mr. President.", PNG,2022
 GEO_77_2022,"Statement by H.E.  Mr. Irakli Garibashvili 
Prime Minister of Georgia 
Gene ral Debate of the 77th Session of the  UN General  Assembly 
New York, Septe mber 22, 2022 
 
 
 
Mr. President,  
Mr. Secretary -General,  
Dear Colleagues,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
On behalf of the Georgian people, it is an honor to speak to you again at the United Nations General 
Assembly.   
As we gather for this 77th Session, we reflect on our founding principles and the progress we have 
made as an international community since the cr eation of the United Nations. At the first Session in 
1946, the founders vowed to unite to maintain global peace and security.  
While we have made significant advances , we must acknowledge the ongoing acts of aggression 
against members of this body – the very same types of acts that led to the establishment of the United 
Nations after World War II.  
In 2008, my country  was attacked by Russia resulting in the ongoing  occupation of 20 percent of our 
territory. At the time , the international community recognized this aggression . But, as we have learned, 
the world’s democracies must act as one to ensure that freedom and peace prevail .  
The UN was founded t o ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war "" and protect state 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is our duty. It is our promise.Today, I have the privilege of representing Georgia, a strong , proud, freedom -loving nation  that has 
preserved its sacred heritage and history , while also evolv ing and adapt ing to the geopolitical realities 
of 21st centur y.  
Thirty years ago, Georgia became part of the United Nations famil y. Now more than ever we are 
committed to protecting our shared values in our region and worldwide.   
We seek all opportunities for collaboration with our international partners to advance the cause of 
peace. In that regard, the Geneva International Discussions are particularly crucial to bring the Russian 
Federation to the table to address the implementat ion of the EU -mediated 2008 Ceasefire Agreement. 
Georgia appreciates the international community's support for its sovereignty and territorial integrity.  
Though my country is still occupied by Russia , we do not let this difficult challenge define us. We 
continue to punch above our weight and contribute to the international community.   
Since our government came to power in 2012, we have implemented an ambitious reform agenda that 
brought us closer to our key international partners, the EU, United States, NATO, and the United 
Nations.  For the first time since we regained independence, Georgia has enjoyed  an unprecedented 
decade of peace, prosperity, and stability .   
We are continuously working on Georgia's global positioning and are already rea lizing the rewards. 
According to the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, Georgia is 1st in Eastern Europe and 
Central Asia. The Open Budget Index ranked Georgia as 1st in the world in terms of budget 
transparency; and according to  the Fraser Institute Economic Freedom of the World 2021 , Georgia is 
among the top 5 economies, along with Singapore and Switzerland. NUMBEO named Georgia one of 
the world's safest countries , ranking 14th globally.  
Our work to align more closely with the US and Europe goes ha nd and hand with our commitment to 
continued democratic transformation. Increased Euro -Atlantic and  European integration is our way of 
returning to the family of European  nations, with whom we share history, culture, and most 
importantly, values.  
We are c ontinuing our unequivocal path towards European and Euro -Atlantic integration. Our 
commitment to these goals is backed up by actions and real results, including an Association 
Agreement , DCFTA, and visa -free travel with the EU .  
This year, we applied for full EU membership.  
The historic decision of the European Council to give us  a European Perspective, created a new set of 
benchmarks . Just as in the past, Georgia will meet and exceed those benchmarks.The prospect of acceding to the EU is a strong motivation for our country and our citizens. We are 
fully aware that the European perspective comes with a responsibility of the highest political, 
economic, and legal convergence with the EU. Georgia immediat ely responded to the European 
Council’s decision by presenting an action plan to address  the EU’s 12 priorities . 
This inclusive  process ensures full engagement of all branches of government, the opposition parties, 
and civil society. The working groups hav e been  established in parliament for each priority area with 
all relevant stakeholders. We are making progress and are well ahead of schedule.  
Let me be clear: Georgia deserves EU member  candidate status, which will bring us to eventual 
membership and make  the dream of generations a reality.  
We have developed a long -term development strategy – Vision 2030 – a nationwide policy document 
that covers key directives and priorities of our general development by  2030  that fully complies with 
the Sustainable Development Agenda of the United Nations.  
The country  has a new National Strategy for Human Rights Protection for the years 2022 -2030. The 
government approved this strate gy following discussions with both international partners and domestic 
civil society organizations. The S trategy aims to further improv e human rights protection standards 
and is in line with the UN sustainable development goals. This comprehensive document covers all 
fundamental human rights and freedoms.  
We are working with the world's leading firms and brightest minds to transform Georgia into a true 
multi -dimensional region al hub.  
Our financial services  sector  is globally  recognized , and now we are attracting international investors, 
injectin g additional investments in the education and healthcare sectors; the startup ecosystem is 
thriving; logistics and energy potential  are now realized . Collectively these created a sustainable and 
predictable economy for Georgia and its people.   
Our government ’s sound policies  led to a strong recovery from the COVID -19 pandemic with 
economic growth reaching 10.4 percent in 2021  and far exceed ing expectations from January -July 
2022  at 10.3 percent. According to the IMF, our growth projections are up to 9 percent  for 2022, 
primarily due to our government's proactive measures to minimize the impacts of post -Covid recovery  
and the War in Ukraine .  
We are creating opportunities and giving all the necessary tools to our citizens, including those living 
in Georgia’s  occupied territories. For that reason, here today at the United Nations General Assembly, 
I want to speak directly to my Abkhaz and Ossetian brothers and sisters and once again tell them thatour strength is in unity . We will build Georgia together and peacefully turn it into a prosperous, free 
and unified European state.  
War is waging again, not far from the doorstep of my country. Russia’s full -fledged war in Ukraine 
undermines Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty , as well as th e UN Charter and fundamental 
principles of international law.  
Georgia stands with Ukraine. Since the start of the war, our government  has provid ed substantial 
humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, including the allocation of more than 1 ,000 tons of humanitarian 
aid. Georgia provides financial assistance and accommodation to over 32,000 Ukrainians currently 
residing in our country.  
The Georgia n education system has enrolled more than 1,500 Ukrainian students, many of whom 
receive general  education in the Ukrainian language according to the standard Ukrainian curricula.  
We have s ponsor ed, joined, or supported almost 400 resolutions , statements, joint statements and other 
initiatives made or proposed by all major international organizations and institutions in support of 
Ukraine, including being a main sponsor  of the UNGA76 resolution on the humanitarian consequences 
of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.   
As confirmed by the U.S. State Department’s r eport on the investment climate in Georgia, “the 
National Bank of Georgia and Georgian financial  institutions act fully in accordance  with the financial 
sanctions imposed by the United States and others on the Russian Federation.”  
We have aligned with res trictive measures of the EU against Crimea and Sevastopol since 2014, and 
this year, with restrictive measures on Donetsk and Luhansk.  
As the conflict in Ukraine has shown , the wider Black Sea Security is at the forefront of the Euro -
Atlantic Security agenda, and Georgia, as an indivisible part of the regional architecture, is ready to 
increase our contribution to common security.  
As we know well, security brings stability, and stability brings predictability. Predictability is a crucial 
precondition f or sustainable economic development. The more predictable the Black Sea region 
becomes, the more we can unlock its economic potential for the benefit of our people and the global 
economy.  
For that reason, we are developing strategic transport corridors c onnecting Asia with Europe. Georgia 
participates in several international initiatives and infrastructure projects with our European colleagues 
to improve connectivity and facilitate reliable and efficient commerce across the Black Sea.Despite the comple x situation in our region, we spare no effort to foster rapprochement between our 
neighbors.  We have already had success stories, including the safe return of 15 Armenian detainees to 
their homelan d in exchange for  maps of mined territories  to Aze rbaijan .  
This July, for the first time the Foreign Ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia met in Tbilisi . We are 
ready to serve as a venue for this dialogue to bring much -needed  peace and stability to our region.   
With this in mind, Georgia has been promoting the P eaceful Neighborhood Initiative, which envisions 
participa tion by all three states of the South Caucasus . This new initiative is not substituting, 
countering, or opposing any other cooperation formats. Georgia serves as  an honest broker to aid in 
normalizing regional relations .  
We are also heavily investing in our country's infrastructur e to increase Georgian transit capabilities  
for the benefit of the region . We aim to attract greater institutional foreign investment, facilitate 
projects of regional importance, and strengthen our infrastructural capabilities - thus becoming an 
actual bridge between East and West.  
Our goal is to transform the South Caucasus into a region of opportunities and economic growth.  
We are already discussing with our EU counterparts a list of “flagship projects ”, which will bring 
additional economic synergies and serve as a catalyst for more connectivity and integration with the 
EU and European market s.  
We believe all countries of  the South Caucasus and allies from the West will benefit from this 
collaboration. We must  act now to  secure the Black Sea, protect  energy routes, maintain supply  chains, 
and increase regional connectivity to foster greater economic development . These are all essential to 
European peace and prosperity.  
We are mindful that our regional challenges are happening against a ba ckdrop of global challenges, 
such as international security,  the pandemic , and climate change.    
Georgia contributes to Global Peace an d the Rules -Based International order. For over two decades, 
Georgia has contributed to NATO mission s around the world, serving as one of the largest per capita 
contribut ors to the mission in Afghanistan. We lost  many  brave soldiers in these missions  and suffered 
significant casualties. Georgia reiterates its readiness to stand by NATO in protecting common security 
while continuing to support the EU -led missions.  
As I speak here today, dangers are threatening all of humanity that we can no longer ignore . The 
planetary crises created by climate change, from biodiversity loss to pollution, represent an existentialthreat. Like many challenges, it affects developing nations first, hindering the ability to realize 
sustainable development goals . 
In Georgia, our government has made significant investments  in education, public health, and the 
environment to ensure that future generations can thrive.   
Education systems are critical for empowering prosperous and productive societies. Education in the 
21st century  means investing in digital literacy and promoting infrastructure to bridge the digital divide 
to ensure that future cris es, whether public health, war, or climate -related, do not create dire situations.  
In conclusion, I believe that working together we shall return peace and prosperity to our homes and 
countries. This is the spirit and the mandate vested in the United Nations from its founding  - to support 
and ensure peace and cooperation.  
I am proud to represent my country before you today. After three  decades of restored independence,  
Georgian Dreams are becoming a reality ! In recent decades our  nation, whose history traces back 
thousands of years, has become an example of resilience and progress in the face of extraordinary 
challenges. With our international partners, I am confident that we will build a brighter, more peaceful, 
and prosperous wo rld now and for the generations that will follow us.   
Thank you!", GEO,2022

Sted:  New York   
Dato : 20. september 2022   
Check against delivery  
President, Secretary General, Excellencies, 
Ladies and gentlemen.  
 
 
We live in challenging  times. As a global 
community we face  dire consequences from war, 
climate change, the pandemic, food insecurity 
and inequality. The Secretary -General 
underlined this eloquently in his address on 
Tuesday: we have the values and principles 
necessary to deal with these challenges: they are 
enshr ined in the Charter of the United Nations.  
 
No country is unfaced by these challenges. And 
we can only successfully respond to them 
together.  
 
 
That is precisely why we have the United 
Nations. The UN was born out of crisis, to unite 
strength and enable nations to raise above 
narrow self -interests and find common ground. 
This  is what we need to turn to again.  
 
The UN Charter sets out clear principles for a 
rules -based international order. This rules -
based order is under attack.  
 
February 2022 ushered in what we hoped we 
would never witness again - a new large -scale 
war in Europe.  
 
Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine has led 
to massive suffering, large -scale humanitarian 
needs and destruction of civilian infrastructure. 
Russia bears sole responsibility for the war and 
its consequences. And Russia is responsible for 
bringing it to an end.  
 
Russia’s actions are i n blatant breach of the UN 
Charter - and therefore something that 
concern s us all.  
 
 
The war is also having devastating global 
consequences. 
It has undermined multilateral cooperation 
when we need it the most.  
 
It has accelerated a negative economic spiral 
and jeopardised the 2030 Agenda.  
 
We are all feeling the repercussions of the war: 
energy supply is under pressure; inflation is 
soaring; and food insecurity has increased 
dramatically.  
 
Ordinary people across the globe – not least 
people in developing countries – are paying the 
price.  
 
The war is amplifying other crises, and 
compounding the impacts of climate change and 
armed conflict in other parts of the world:  
 
The Horn of Africa is faced with its worst 
drought in more than four decades.  
 
Pakistan is contending with devastating floods. 
More than 300 million people affected by 
conflicts and humanitarian crises are in need of 
humanitar ian assistance and protection.  
 
In many armed conflicts, there is  a lack of 
respect for international humanitarian law , and  
civilians are paying the price.  
 
A few years ago, it appeared that hunger would 
soon be a scourge of the past. Now food 
insecurity  is on the rise.  
 
No continent is more vulnerable to the 
combined effects of climate change, conflicts 
and growing food insecurity than Africa.  
 
Norway stands in solidarity with the people 
grappling with these inter locking  crises.  
 
We have allocated more funding to 
humanitarian assistance  and development 
cooperation in 2022 than ever before.    
 
President, 
The war of aggression against Ukraine is a 
challenge to the norms at the foundation of the 
United Nations. We are stand ing up to confront 
that challenge.  
 
Some hold the  conviction that authoritarian 
regimes are strong, while democracies are frail, 
and likely to crack under pressure. We are 
prov ing them wrong.  
 
Together with a strong alliance of partners, we 
are stand ing with Ukraine and aid its self-
defence. As Europe’s largest supplier of energy, 
we do what we can to enhance Europe’s 
resilience.  
 
 
 
President,  
We are stand ing up for human rights and 
fundamenta l freedoms elsewhere.  
Norway will continue to promote civic space, 
protect human rights defenders and support 
media diversity and independent journalism 
worldwide. 
 
Women’s and girls’ participation in society and 
their right to decide over their own bodies are 
essential for democratic and sustainable 
development, not least in times of conflict and 
war. Safeguarding these human rights remains 
one of our top priorities.   
 
While supporting  Ukraine, we must not forget  
conflicts elsewhere . Norway is continuing its 
peace diplomacy and peacebuilding efforts in 
major conflicts across the globe.  
 
As part of our longstanding engagement in the 
Middle East, we are push ing for an end to the 
Israeli -Palestinian conflict.  
 
In Colombia, the new Government has 
expressed its commitment to implementing the 
peace agreement with the FARC, and to 
initiating formal negotiations with the ELN 
guerrilla group. The ELN also seems inclined to 
renew dialogue. 
As a guarantor country, Norway remains 
committed to Colombia’s quest for peace, and 
to supporting the parties in this endeavour.  
 
In all the peace processes Norway is engaged in, 
we promote active involvement and 
participation by women in line with the wo men, 
peace and security agenda.  
 
We talk to all parties as we work to achieve 
peaceful conflict resolution. Without dialogue , 
we have no opportunity to influence the parties 
and encourage them to move in a more positive 
direction.  
 
 
Norway also strongly supports the good offices 
of the Secretary -General in conflicts worldwide. 
We commend him and his dedicated team for 
their important work on the Black Sea Grain 
Initiative - and Türkiye for its important 
contribution. 
The prices of f ood, fuel and fertiliser were 
already high before the war in Ukraine, but the 
war has dramatically exacerbated the situation.  
 
If the global community does not act swiftly, the 
current food price crisis will develop into a food 
availability and food suppl y crisis.  
 
Together with fighting climate change, Norway 
has placed food security at the top of its 
development agenda. This year we are 
allocating more than 300 million dollars in 
funding for  food security initiatives alone.  
 
 
 
We need to:  
• increase human itarian assistance and 
enhance social safety nets;  
• promote local food production in the Global 
South;  
• secure access to seeds, fertilisers, and 
technology for small -scale farmers;  and 
• accelerate the transformation to climate -
resilient and sustainable food s ystems.  
 
In all of this, we must ensure that the needs of 
women and girls are adequately integrated.  
 
We are all dependent on a collective response if 
we are to succeed in addressing climate change 
and the loss of biodiversity. Currently we are 
not on track.  
 
 
 
Norway will honour its commitment to cut 
greenhouse gas emissions and to play a key role 
in the  green transition.  
 
We have listened to the concerns of developing 
countries. And we have decided to double our 
climate finance to these countries by 2026. 
Within this target, we aim to at least triple our 
funding for climate adaptation and resilience.  
 
Climate change affects millions of people 
worldwide and increases the needs of vulnerable 
people. The current humanitarian system will 
not be able to meet the increasing humanitarian 
needs.  
 
As global warming continues, weather and 
climate ext remes will increasingly have an 
impact on armed conflict. Climate and security 
are already closely interlinked.  
 
The fight against climate change requires new, 
innovative approaches. The Global Energy 
Alliance for People and Planet brings together 
private  and public resources.  
 
As co -chair, Norway will work with partners 
across the Global South to support renewable 
energy transitions, reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, increase clean power, and create 
green jobs.  
 
 
The oceans can be a vital part of the solu tion to 
climate change, food insecurity and poverty. If 
adequately managed and protected, the oceans 
hold the key to reaching many of the 
Sustainable Development Goals.  
 
 
The High -level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean 
Economy , co-chaired by Norway , is an in itiative 
by world leaders committed to ocean health and 
ocean wealth, in support of the 2030 Agenda.  
 
The Panel members have committed to 
sustainably manage 100% of the ocean areas 
under their national jurisdiction. We will 
establish Sustainable Ocean Pla ns and urge 
other coastal states to do the same.  
 
The fifth session of the UN’s Environmental 
Assembly, was an important breakthrough for 
multilateral cooperation on environmental 
issues. Norway  will work to ensure an effective 
agreement on combating plastic pollution 
through a life -cycle approach. 
We must no t overlook existing crises as new 
ones emerge. The pandemic is not over. We 
cannot go from COVID -19 panic to COVID -19 
neglect. We must use the lessons learned from 
COVID -19 and the ACT Accelerator. This will 
be key to preventing, preparing and responding 
to new outbreaks of infectious disease.  
 
 
President,  
 
Russia’s unlawful act of aggression against 
Ukraine heightened geopolitical tens ions and 
posed obstacles to multilateral cooperation.  
 
As a Security Council member, Norway has 
consistently sought to strengthen the Council’s 
mandate to maintain international peace and 
security.  
 
And despite increased geopolitical tensions, the 
Securi ty Council has retained its ability to 
adopt important resolutions. 
We secured a robust mandate for the UN in 
Afghanistan. Together with Niger, we 
negotiated a ground -breaking resolution on the 
protection of education in armed conflict. And 
we partnere d with Ghana on a resolution on 
maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea.  
 
President,  
 
In times of crisis and rising global tensions, we 
all feel the pressure  to put domestic concerns 
before global solidarity.  
 
In times of distress it is only natural for p olitical 
leaders to try to look after their  own 
population s. 
 
But there is no contradiction between this and 
engaging with the rest of the world. Quite the 
contrary.  
 
We are bound together, we are dependent on 
each other and we have a shared destiny. 
Without a strong and effective UN, the 
international community will not be able to 
address the challenges we face.  That is why we 
applaud and support the Secretary -General’s  
‘Our Common Agenda’ report. If anything, it is 
even more urgent to implement this  report now 
than when it was launched.  
 
The Summit of the Future in September 2024 
will be an important milestone. We expect an 
ambitious Declaration on Future Generations, 
and look forward to engaging with the High -
level Advisory Board and member states in the 
process ahead.  
 
President,  
 
We are living in challenges  times. But w e must 
not lose hope. We must face the present 
challenges with resolve and recall the strength 
we can muster when we act together.  
 
Thank you.", NOR,2022

ADDRESS  
 
 
BY 
HIS EXCELLENC Y 
DR LAZARUS MCCARTHY CHAKWERA  
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI   
 
 
 DURING THE GENERAL DEBATE OF THE 77TH SESSION  
OF THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
AT THE UN HEADQUARTERS  
 
 
  
NEW YORK, NEW YORK, USA  
THUR SDAY, 22ND SEPTEMBER  2022 
 Your Excellency Mr. Csaba Kőrösi, President of the 77th 
Session of the General Assembly ; 
Your Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary -
General ; 
Excellencies;  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
Leave No  One Behind!  
These four words are  the promise  at the heart  of the 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That is the  
principle  this UN body  committed to . But today, over 
three and a half years  after that commitment was made , 
smaller nations  and younger democracies  around t he 
world already  feel like this was an empty promise. 
Today, not only do smaller nations and younger 
democracies like Malawi still feel left behind, but  feel 
much farther behind than before.  
 
For instance, we all know that Climate Change is a global 
problem that will never be solved unless all nations solve 
 it together , yet months after Malawi and its SDG gains 
were set backwards by two tropical storms in quick 
succession, we have been left behind.   
We all know that p andemics  are a global problem that 
will never be solved unless all nations solve it together, 
yet in the rollout of vaccines and application of  travel 
restriction , we have been left behind.   
We all know that regional i nsecurity is a global problem 
that will never be solved unless all nations solve i t 
together, yet  in the participation of  UN Security Council 
decisions that affect us , we have been left behind.  
And we all know that food shortage is a global problem 
that will never be solved until all nations solve it 
together, yet in the allocation o f international facilities 
for agro -based and debt -distressed economies , we have 
been left behind.  
And as a result of our collective negligence, t he global 
economy is  now a house on fire, yet we continue to use 
evacuation methods that rush some nations out to 
safety while leaving the rest of us behind to fend for 
ourselves in the burning building. But if we are truly o ne 
 UN family , then leaving no one behind has to be 
practiced, not just preached. If we are truly one UN 
family,  we must reject any attempts  to politicise human 
suffering by  lobbying  us to  refuse the help of those some  
find political ly offensive.  If we are truly one UN family, 
we must get out of political posturing and welcome more 
helping hands in resolving the problems the permanent 
UN Security Council member s have sometimes created 
and which they have  failed to solve  alone, namely  the 
failure to stop envi ronmental degradation , the failure to 
prevent unjust wars , the failure to lift  unsustainable 
debt burden s, the failure to prevent  food insecurity , and 
the failure to  contain pandemics.  
 
So, Mr. President, how do we get back on  track? As I see 
it, with so many  left behind, the only thing to do is to 
concentrate the UN’s support on the most vulnerable 
who are lagging behind so that they can catch up. And 
Malawi stands  ready to do its  part in using  any new  
support we get  to make up for lost ground and catch u p. 
 On addressing the current global food crisis, Malawi is 
ready to catch up, having just joined the Feed the Future 
initiative, giving us access to new financing in the next 
few years to use Malawi’s vast arable land and large 
volumes of fresh water to d evelop mega farms that will 
feed the world and lift millions of our farmers out of 
subsistence living. And we are delighted that many 
private sector investors are flocking to us to join the 
agricultural revolution that is coming to Malawi, as well 
as investors in mining, who know that the recent 
discovery in Malawi of the largest deposit of rutile in the 
world means that Malawi’s economic rise is imminent.  
 
On climate change mitigation and adaptation, Malawi is 
ready to catch up. So with COP27 around t he corner in 
Sharm -El-Sheikh, we call for  action on the pledges  
already made , so that  Malawi and o ther Least Developed 
Countries can build resilience to climate -change 
induced events like floods, dro ught, pests, and cyclones, 
all projected to become more  frequent and more severe . 
 These  disasters are reversing  years of  developmental  
gains . Cyclones Ana and Gombe  alone  destroyed 
strategic infrastructure, community  assets, and 
displaced  thousands of households.  And now a fifth of 
our people are at risk of acute food shortage as 3.6 
million Malawians are facing hunger from next month 
until March.  While we are preparing to deploy food 
assistance from our strategic reserves, we welcome your 
support with early warning systems for generatin g and 
managing climate data to r educe the impacts of 
disasters, as well as technical and financial capacity 
building  in weather data analysi s, modelling and 
forecasting to address barriers faced by farmers in 
accessing useful  information. Our ongoing  
institutionalization of the National Climate Change 
Fund should help in this regard, as will other measures 
for making climate financing  predictable .  
 
Although Malawi and other Least Developed Countries  
contribute the least to climate change, we  are 
committed to the global  climate agenda . Malawi’s own 
ambition is to cut carbon emissions by half  before the 
 year 2040, and so we call for  support towards our efforts 
to transition to clean and green energy.  
 
On dealing with the evolving challenge of COVID -19, 
Malawi is again ready to catch up .  Crucial to this effort 
is access to vaccines , and your support to our efforts to 
catch up in this area will strengthen  our vaccine delivery 
systems in general. But the critical need for us is 
strengthening health syste ms more broadly to build 
resilience against future pandemic s, which calls for  
invest ments in health infrastructure and  research . In 
this context, the news that six African states have been 
chosen  to produce messenger RNA vaccines in Africa  is 
music to my e ars, and I am proud of Malawi’s advocacy 
of this approach , as well as Malawi’s role as a co -pioneer 
of the Accord for a Healthier World announced by Pfizer 
in Davos four mont hs ago, aimed at bringing quality 
medicines  to 1.2 billion people in low -income countries.  
 
These action -oriented partnerships , are examples of the 
importance of SDG 17 in the advancement of all other 
 Sustainable Development Goals . We own the SDGs fully, 
and Malawi has so far undertaken two Voluntary National 
Reviews (VNRs) since 2020 to strengthen the national 
ownership of the same . But we  see global private -public 
partnerships  as essential to  reclaiming the gains we have 
lost on SDGs in the recent months of global crises . It is 
because of our collaborative approach that  we are on 
track in  implementing 60% of the goals, and we are now 
in the process of reviewing the UN Sustainable 
Development Cooperation Framework for the period 
2024 to 2028 so that it is resp onsive to nati onal 
development plans  linked to the delivery of the SDGs.  
And in that spirit of partnership, we also plan to make 
full use of  the Doha Programme of Action for LDCs  to 
catch up on SDGs even more.  And speaking of LDCs, it 
is my pleasure as Cha ir to invite you to the 5th United 
Nations Conference of Least Developed Countries to be 
held in Doha, Qatar,  in March, 2023, where even more 
partnerships will be forged around creating solutions for  
vulnerable countries. 
 One problem in desperate  need of a solution for the most 
vulnerable LDCs is the unsustainable debt  levels and 
distress they bear . It is not for nothing that the 
Scriptures, which are regarde d as sacred to more than 
half the people  on this planet, describe unsustainable 
debt as a form  of slavery. And as leaders of generations 
past worked together to end old forms of slavery, so we 
too must work together to end this new fo rm.  
 
Recently, the Managing Director of the International 
Monetary Fund called on the world’s major lenders to 
show  leadership by relieving vulnerable countries of the 
debts that are shackling them, because even loans that 
were given and received in good faith have become 
unsustainable in the recent and current climate of 
relentless and unforeseen external shocks. I therefore 
join her in reiterating that call, and I  commend the 
People’s Repu blic of China for leading by example by  
fulfilling the pledge it made at last year’s Forum on 
China -Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) to forgive interest -
free loans owed by 17 African count ries. 
 Let this be the beginning of breaking the chains holding 
vulnerable coun tries back, not the end, because when we 
say that we are le aving no one behind, this is one way  to 
put our money where our mouth is. Let me hasten to add  
that as President of a country that stands to benefit from 
debt-relief measures, I do not regard my country as 
entitled to such, and am  in fact fully committed to be 
held accountable for the respon sible use of these life 
jackets . I recognize that we too m ust prove ourselves 
worthy of such as sistance by using  it to cushion our 
citizens against the  worsening financial volatility, trade 
cost, and human suffering  the deb t and other external 
factors are  causing.  
 
There must in fact be no member state in our mi dst that  
is beyond scrutiny or exempt from accountability. For 
that to become a reality, US President Biden’s recent call 
for this UN Family to defend the rights of smaller nations 
as equals of larger ones must not only be applauded. It 
must  be uploaded . As African member states, we do not 
wish to gather here next year with no progress made on 
the African Union’s Ezulwini consensus, which demands 
 two permanent seats with veto power and five non -
permanent seats for Africa . So following  the strong 
signal of s upport from the US Government, we expect to 
see this matter on its way to the United Nations Security 
Council to be tabled, heard, and settled .  
 
That is the UN we want.  That is the UN the world needs: 
A reformed UN that practices the equality and 
democracy it preaches; a reformed UN that is not 
constantly polarized by nuclear powers stuck in cold war 
mindsets; a reformed UN that uses its multilateral 
muscle to give equal attention to the interlocking iss ues 
of public health, food insecurity, climate change,  and 
conflict, regardless of where they emerge or whom they 
affect;  a reformed UN that gives equal weight to all its 
members who give it meaning, not just those who give it 
money . Because we are one hum anity facing the same 
storm in the same boat.  
 
In that spirit of human ity, let me conclude by expressing 
my country’s  deepest condolences to the British Royal 
 Family and the government and people of the United 
Kingdom and the Commonwealth on  the passing  of 
Queen Elizabeth II, who was laid to rest on the eve  of 
this Assembly’s High -Level Debate week .  
 
Mr. Csaba Kőrösi, President of the 77th Session of the 
United Nations General Asse mbly, I thank you for this 
opportunity, and I congratulate you on your 
appointm ent, just as I wish outgoing President  Abdullah 
Shahid the very best in his continued  service to 
humanity  and the cause to Leave No One Behind . 
 
Thank you for listening .", MWI,2022

77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  
Agenda item 8: General Debate 
 
Statement by H.E. David W. Panuelo 
President of the Federated States of Micronesia 
 
 
New York, 22 September 2022              Check agai nst delivery  
 
 
Mr. President, 
Mr. Secretary-General, 
Excellencies, 
Distinguished Delegates, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 
Warmest Greetings from the Paradise in Our Backyard s, the Federated States of Micronesia! 
 
It is my honor to address the UN General Assembly, and in so doing, I bring a warm 
Kaselehlie on behalf of my delegation, the leadersh ip, and the people of the Federated States 
of Micronesia to all of you in attendance today at this 77th Session of the UN General 
Assembly, and to those tuning in virtually from acr oss the globe.  
 
I express my country’s gratitude as we join other M embers of this august body in extending 
our heartiest congratulations to you, Mr. President , on your election to the Presidency of the 
77th General Assembly. We wish also to thank your d istinguished predecessor, His 
Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his excellent le adership during the 76th UNGA. I would 
also like to pay our respects to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who continues to 
demonstrate dedication and integrity in his role.  
 
Mr. President, 
 
I will begin by reiterating that the Federated Stat es of Micronesia’s foreign policy is to be a 
friend to all and an enemy to none; that we extend to all peoples and nations that which we 
seek: peace, friendship, cooperation, and love in o ur common humanity. 
 As leaders of the world, it is our duty and obligat ion to take bold decisions that serve our 
citizens as well as our values. Every person in thi s room and beyond is impacted, in some 
form, by the brutal and unjustified invasion of Ukr aine. The unprovoked attack against the 
People of Ukraine by another member of the United N ations is illegal, blatantly disregards 
international laws and norms, and undermines the UN  Charter whose purposes and principles 
are to maintain international peace and security. 
 
To the People and Government of Ukraine: the People  and Government of Micronesia 
support you in your quest to defend your families a nd homes. Micronesia strongly 
encourages all other Peoples and Governments, most particularly those with greater influence 
and means, to firmly stand with the People and Gove rnment of Ukraine, and show that the 
People of the 21st Century cannot, and will not, to lerate aggressive and violent behavior. An 
infringement on the rights of one is an infringemen t on the rights of us all, and we do well to 
stand with our neighbors lest we one day find ourse lves standing alone. 
 
Mr. President, 
 
While traditional security concerns have taken much  of our World’s attention in recent 
memory, for Micronesia, as a Pacific Island Country , it must continue to be emphasized that 
the most enduring security threat to the Pacific, a nd to the World, is in the form of 
anthropogenic Climate Change.  
 
The Federated States of Micronesia presents its mos t urgent appeal to the global community, 
especially the developed countries, to commit to th e intent of the Paris Agreement by 
providing adequate, accessible, and concessional fi nance for climate mitigation and 
adaptation, as well as for loss and damage.  On los s and damage specifically, Micronesia 
calls for the adoption of an agenda item for COP 27  on a Loss and Damage Response Fund, 
the establishment of that Fund in COP 27, and the f ull operationalization of the Fund to be 
completed in COP 28. The Federated States of Micron esia cannot overemphasize the 
extreme urgency of limiting global warming to 1.5 d egrees through rapid, deep, and 
sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  However, to the extent that mitigation, as 
well as adaptation, are not sufficient to avert or minimize loss and damage, finance must be 
provided with all due haste to help vulnerable comm unities, like those of my country, to 
recover from Climate Change-related loss and damage . 
 
Current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions remain wholly inadequate. The world is 
leaving 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming in our wake and rapidly speeding towards – and soon 
past – 1.5 degrees. Despite warnings of dangerous f eedbacks and tipping points, many actors 
still continue to engage in the worst emitting acti vities. They ignore the solutions that could 
address climate while supporting development goals in favor of business-as-usual. 
Fortunately, the tide is changing on CO2 emissions,  but still too slowly. Moreover, research 
shows that efforts to reduce CO2 alone will not coo l the planet in the near-term. Only 
mitigation of methane – the second most potent gree nhouse gas – and the other short-lived 
climate pollutants can prevent the world from excee ding the 2-degree upper limit over the 
next two decades. Doing so is key to ensuring count ries can put their adaptation plans in 
 place while additional CO2 mitigation gets underway . Micronesia urges all countries to 
commit to the Kigali Amendment and the Global Metha ne Pledge to see a 30% reduction of 
methane emissions from 2020 levels by 2030.  
 
Mr. President, 
 
This is my fourth address at this august body, and in my previous three addresses I have 
urged the United States of America and the People’s  Republic of China to consider Climate 
Change a non-political and non-competitive issue fo r cooperation, as solving the Climate 
Change crisis ultimately requires both of these sup erpowers to work together. 
 
For the briefest period of time, it seemed as if th e Americans, with whom Micronesia shares 
an Enduring Partnership, and the Chinese, with whom  Micronesia shares a Great Friendship, 
were starting to work together on this issue, despi te increases in tension in other areas. Now, 
they are no longer speaking to each other on this i mportant issue. 
 
Micronesia cannot understand why our partners and f riends cannot get along on this issue of 
total international importance, but one way to get attention and action is to explicitly call 
your closest friends and allies by name instead of talking around the substance. 
 
President Xi and President Biden—both of you are fr iends of Micronesia. I respect both of 
you and your peoples and your countries. As the two  superpowers in this world, you both set 
the tone and cadence for global conversations. It i s my wish that you can respect each other 
so that you can see with eyes wide open that it is Micronesia’s strongest desire, and the 
desire of the rest of the Pacific Island Countries,  that you resume cooperation on tackling 
Climate Change. Micronesia says this to each of you  bilaterally and multilaterally, in the 
quietest conversations in the Presidents’ Office an d in the loudest conversations streamed 
across the World, because it is our most important issue. Your capacity to cooperate on 
Climate Change is necessary towards ensuring our Wo rld is habitable for future generations, 
and does not suffer from civilizational collapse.  
 
Mr. President, 
 
Ours is undoubtedly an inter-dependent world where we share common goals for 
sustainability; I am of the view that, through coop eration, we have a better chance of 
building healthy societies that we can proudly pass  on to our children, and a World that 
values the rights of every individual and every soc iety. 
 
Mr. President, 
 
I want to personally thank the leadership of this o rganization and its Members for the support 
extended to my country in establishing the Multi-Co untry Office (MCO) for the North 
Pacific. I am proud to announce that the establishm ent of the MCO has added value to our 
response to COVID-19, and accessing available fundi ng sources and technical support 
 through the United Nations System. Small Island Dev eloping States such as Micronesia are 
in dire need of support from our partners to suppor t our country-driven development strategy.   
 
Distance continues to be a challenge in providing s ervice delivery and, with the efforts 
provided by the UN MCO, I wish to acknowledge and c ommend the UN Agencies for their 
diligent work in making sure that they reach every island in my country and in the 
Micronesia sub-region, including the vulnerable out lying islands.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
While acknowledging our interest in strengthening o ur tourism sector and developing value-
added agricultural products, investment in the Blue  Economy is our main aim, whereby our 
government works closely with the private sector fo r the benefit of all.   Sustainable fisheries 
management and protection of the environment are th erefore essential in our endeavor to 
sustain marine life for our future generations. 
 
In 2022, we have focused a substantial amount of wo rk on the Ocean, with mixed results. 
While the outcome of the Our Ocean Conference in Pa lau and the 2022 UN Ocean 
Conference in Lisbon both concluded successfully, c ritical works remain to be accomplished 
when it comes to fully protecting the Ocean resourc es considered as common heritage of 
mankind. 
 
In March of this year, we, as an international comm unity, were unable to finalize an 
international legally binding instrument to conserv e and sustainably use marine biological 
diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (or  BBNJ); and, just last month, we had to 
pause the 5th Session of the Intergovernmental Conf erence because we ran out of our allotted 
time. It is imperative that we finalize this work a s soon as possible, so that we can protect 
Ocean resources effectively.  Micronesia looks forw ard to the resumption, and conclusion, of 
the BBNJ negotiation very soon. 
 
This past summer, Micronesia announced that we were  joining the Alliance of Countries for 
a Deep-Sea Mining Moratorium, alongside a number of  fellow Pacific SIDS.   It is the view 
of Micronesia that deep seabed mining in the intern ational seabed Area should not occur 
until the Precautionary Principle, Ecosystem Approa ch, and the Polluter Pays Principle have 
been implemented.  In the international seabed Area , no such implementation can take place 
in the absence of the finalization of a robust, res ponsible, and comprehensive set of 
exploitation regulations by the International Seabe d Authority.  To do otherwise will be a 
dereliction of our duty to protect and preserve the  marine environment and respect the 
common heritage of mankind. 
 
Turning to maritime areas within our national juris diction, the vast expanse of Micronesia’s 
maritime zones represents both an opportunity and, at the same time, an enormous challenge.  
We have some of the largest fishing grounds in the Pacific, covering an area of 1.1 million 
square miles, and one of the most productive tuna f isheries in the Western and Central 
Pacific. 
 Our maritime zones are exposed to the threats of tr ansnational crimes and illegal activities.  
We need our partners to support us in capacity-buil ding efforts towards law enforcement in 
the areas of maritime surveillance, money launderin g and terrorist financing, drug 
trafficking, and other transnational crimes. 
 
We are thankful to Australia for donating two Guard ian-Class patrol boats, and also grateful 
to Japan for complementing these assets with four s maller patrol boats for nearby coastal 
waters. We recognize the U.S. Coast Guard as an end uring partner in protecting our 
expansive ocean territory. 
  
But, given our vast EEZ and extended continental sh elves reaching beyond 200 nautical 
miles, we invite additional countries to assist us in acquiring more assets with much more 
advanced maritime surveillance capabilities such as  drones and submersibles. Our law 
enforcement, border management, and maritime survei llance teams would benefit from more 
partnership in capacity-building and support to con tinually enhance their law enforcement 
maritime skills. 
      
Mr. President,  
 
Speaking further about the common heritage of manki nd, Micronesia wishes to express our 
gravest concern about Japan’s decision to discharge , starting next year, nuclear-contaminated 
water, otherwise known as Advanced Liquid Processin g System (ALPS) water into the 
ocean.  We cannot close our eyes to the unimaginabl e threats of nuclear contamination, 
marine pollution, and eventual destruction of the B lue Pacific Continent.  The impacts of this 
decision are both transboundary and intergeneration al in nature.  As Micronesia’s Head of 
State, I cannot allow for the destruction of our Oc ean resources that support the livelihood of 
our people.   
 
Mr. President,  
 
The Leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum face the f uture with a lot of optimism.  As Leaders, 
we adopted key structural reforms for the Forum tha t strengthen our Region through the Suva 
Agreement.  The reforms include selection and sub-r egional rotation of the Secretary General 
position, hosting of a sub-regional office of the F orum in Micronesia, hosting of the Office of 
the Pacific Ocean Commissioner in Micronesia, and t he filling of the head of this office by 
Micronesia.  We are implementing these reforms in g ood faith to strengthen unity among the 
Pacific nations as one family.  
 
We also adopted the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Paci fic Continent. This Strategy represents 
an important bridge into the future—a unique opport unity for our region to develop long-
term approaches to address our common challenges. T he solidarity of our region will 
strengthen our collective sense of Pacific regional ism; and, on this premise, we ask our 
partners to assist us—not divide us in any way. 
 The key message, Mr. President, for the United Nati ons as an organization, and all countries 
in the world that engage with the Pacific, is that Micronesia and the rest of the Pacific Islands 
Forum solicit all countries who engage with the Pac ific to support and respect the 2050 
Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. This strat egy is our Pacific Region’s roadmap for 
sustainable development and growth, and we can only  succeed if we work together with the 
support of our international partners. 
 
Mr. President,  
 
I wish to conclude by explicitly calling on all Peo ples and Nations who hear me today to 
know that the People and Government of the Federate d States of Micronesia extend to you 
peace, friendship, cooperation, and love in our com mon humanity. We need you, all of you, 
to stand with us, as nations united, to take action s today for our global prosperity tomorrow. 
 
Thank you, Mr. President, and God Bless our United Nations.", FSM,2022

NEW YORK 
 
Speech of H.E. Hussein Abdelbagi Akol  the Vice President of 
the Republic of South Sudan and Head of the Delegation to 
the 77th UN General Assembly, September 22, 2022 . 
 
Mr. President,  
Mr. Secretary -General,  
Fellow Delegates,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
It is my distinct honour  to address the 77th UN General Assembly 
today on behalf of H.E. Salva Kiir Mayardit, President of the 
Republic of South Sudan. I wish to congratulate the President -
elect, His Excellency Mr. Csaba Kőrösi  of Hungary, on being 
chosen to lead the 77th Session of the UN General Assembly. The 
Government of South Sudan welcomes his Theme  of “Solutions

support sustainable policies and positive social t ransformations.  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
We commend  the Secretary General for convening Transforming  
Education Summit which successfully concluded  this week . I am 
pleased to report that South Suda n is committed to transform its 
education system through  increasing its budget allocation for 
education to 17 .5% of the national budget. Th is investment in 
education will enable us to build more schools and improve 
teachers’ pay and hence set the country on track to achieving 
SDG4 by 2030.  
Excellenc ies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
The Revitalized Peace Agreement on the Resolution of the 
Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan signed on 12th 
September, 2018 between the Government and the opposition 
groups ended the internal conflict in South Su dan. The parties are 
committed to the implementation of the Peace Agreement, which 
 has improved the security in South Sudan. Owing to relative 
peace, the internally displaced and the refugees have been 
voluntarily returning home, although more formal reint egration 
remains a challenge due to limited resources. However, the 
government is doing whatever is possible to resettle the internally 
displaced persons and the refugees.  
On the same note, I am pleased to inform you that the command 
structure of the Natio nal Unified Forces has been established. 
This is a major leap towards transformation and regularization of 
the forces. Since the unification of the command structure in April 
2022, there has been de -escalation in clashes between South 
Sudan Peoples’ Defens e Forces and the SPLA -IO. In addition, 
graduation of the First Batch of 53,000 National Unified Forces 
was successfully graduated  on the 30th of August, 2022.   
I am equally pleased to inform you that the parties to the 
agreement have agreed on a Roadmap to complete the remaining 
tasks in the peace agreement, which will pave way for a peaceful, 
free, fair, and credible election at the end of the transitional perio d 
in 2025 . 
 Fellow  delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Through thoughtful and targeted actions, South Sudan has been 
able to contain the spread of covid -19. The health effects of the 
pandemic in South Sudan have been surprisingly less pronounced 
than expected , marked by very low morbidity and fatality rates. 
As of 9th May 2022, only 17,513 confirmed COVID -19 cases 
including 138 deaths have been reported since the start of the 
pandemic. The current vaccination campaign continues to be 
effective with the coverag e of 45% (entire population over the age 
of 18).  
Excellenc ies,  
Despite this positive health news, the pandemic has had negative 
effects on the economy, starting with dramatic declines in 
domestic production and revenue collection, followed by a rising 
cost of living. These economic consequences are far -reaching, 
severely weakening, for example, human capital formation, 
especially in education, as the lockdown deprived school -age 
children of learning opportunities. 
 Distinguished  delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
In April 2016, South Sudan ratified the Paris Agreement that 
seeks to solidify a global response to the threat of climate change 
by keeping global warming  to well below 2 degrees Celsius. 
South Sudan has strategized to build on nature -based solu tions, 
green infrastructure and foster socioeconomic recovery pathways 
centered on climate change and natural disasters.  
Recently, it became evident to us that climate change is real, the 
impacts of climate change and global warming have since 
manifested in various part of South Sudan. Seventy  to eighty 
percent of South Sudan has  been affected by floods for the last 
three years in a row.  
Excellenc ies, 
The Government of South Sudan, in its analysis of food insecurity 
between the periods of February to March  2022, estimated 6.83 
million people (55.3% of the population) are facing acute food 
insecurity . 2.37 million people are on Emergency level.  The 
severe food insecurity is worsened by combinations of shocks 
 including flooding, prolonged draught, physical in security, and 
the effects of COVID -19. 
Excellen cies, distinguished  delegates,  
South S udan is surrounded by countries afflicted by conflict . As 
part of obligation to promote peace and stability in the region and 
beyond , South Sudan successfully mediated the armed conflict  in 
Sudan which resulted into the signing of Juba Peace Agreement 
in 202 0 in Juba.  South Sudan stands ready to mediate the current 
conflict between the army and the Forces of Freedom and 
Change  (FFC) in Sudan so that Sudan can finally enjoy lasting  
peace . Recently, South Sudan also offered to mediate tensions 
between Egypt and Ethiopia over their disagreement for the 
construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam ( GERD). 
we further demonstrated willingness to mediate the internal 
conflict in Ethiopia  between the Ethiopian government and the 
Tigray People’s Liberation Forces (TPLF) . The Republic of 
South furthermore availed itself ready to mediate border issue 
between the Republic of Sudan and The Federal Democratic 
Republic of Ethiopia. 
 By participating in bringing regional peace and stability, South 
Sudan has demonstrated its ability  as a reliable partner in quest 
for regional and international peace and security.  Further, the 
republic of South Sudan is contributing  one battalion of Peace 
keeping Forces to be part of the East African Forces  to bring 
peace in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  
The current war between Russia  and Ukraine is very unfortunate 
and devastating to the lives and livelihood of the citizens of both 
countries  and beyond.  The war has  led to a severe humanitarian 
crisis where millions are in dire need .  This war has not only 
affected the two warring parties,  but it has far -reaching effects on 
global economy.  From the moral point  of view , South Sudan 
Government is calling on the Russia and Ukraine to cease all 
forms of hostilities and resolve the dispute through diplomatic 
and constructive dialogue to avert further consequences.  
Excellencies,  
The Government of South Sudan appreciates the critical 
humanitarian and technical support made by member states in this 
forum and it looks forward to its continuation . 
 To mitigate effects of flooding on the population and livelihoods, 
South Sudan is donat ing ten million dollars to the WFP to 
alleviate the suffering of the affected displaced communities. 
However, we need the support of the international community to 
reach all the floods and draught affected areas and communities.  
The President of the Republ ic of South Sudan will call a 
conference  of all the humanitarian organizations in South Sudan  
to coordinate humanitarian activities . The government of South 
Sudan is committed to  providing security and protection to the 
relief workers.  
Together, we can save our planet by playing our roles and by 
supporting each other to mitigate effects of climate change and to 
come up with alternative methods and solutions based on 
available prot ocols.  
Finally , the implementation process of the Revitalized Peace 
Agreement is facing numerous challenges and sanctions imposed 
by international partners on individuals and entities  are disservice 
this course . As we make progress  in the  implementation of the  
Revitalized Peace Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in the 
Republic of South Sudan, we are calling upon the International 
 community and UN in particular to revise individual and targeted  
sanctions, arms embargo imposed on Sout h Sudan  to ena ble 
successful complet ion of the remaining provisions of the peace 
agreement outline in the New Roadmap .   
Thank you all.", SSD,2022

 Your Excellency, Csaba  Kőrösis , President of the United Nation s 
General Assembly , 
 
Your Excellency,  António Guterres,  Secretary  General of the United 
Nations , 
 
Excellencies Heads of State and Government , 
Distinguished Delegates ,  
Salutation s 
 
I wish to be gin by conveying , to this August body, fraternal greetings from 
Her Excellency Samia Suluhu Hassan, President of the United Republic of 
Tanzania  who could not attend this year ’s session due t o pressing  national 
commitment s. It is therefore  my distinct  honour and privilege to address the 
77th Session  of the United  Nations  General  Assembly  on behalf  of the 
Government  and People  of the United  Republic  of Tanzania . 
 
Let me join those who have spoken before me in congratulating you, Mr. 
President, on your  election to presi de over  the 77th Session  of the United 
Nations General Assembly . I assure you of Tanzania’s support and 
cooperation as  you discharge your responsibilities.  
 
Let me also  extend our appreciation  to the United Nations  Secretary  
General, H.E. Antón io Guterres  and the enti re UN Secretar iat for their 
dedicated service as guardians of the common interest of all people s and 
all states, particularly during this time of unprecedented global challenges . 
 
Interlocking  Challenges  
 
Mr. President ; 
This Assembl y is convening  at a critical point when  the world  is engulfed  in 
danger ous flames,  ranging  from conflicts and mounting  geopolitical tension s; 
devast ating effects  of the COVID -19 pandemic;  food and energy insecurity; 
environmental  carnage  and extreme  climat e chang e related  events; to barriers  to 
education,  technology  and opportunity  for shared  prosperity.   These  challenges  
are in turn inextricably  linked  with and propelling  stubborn global  poverty.  
Furthermore,  with only 8 years  remaining  before  030,  the world is still way off 
the mark in meeting many  of the target s set in 2015. 
 
The root cause of all these  challenges  is human  greed,  selfish  desire  and 
unilateralism . Yet, we know for sure that unilateralism,  driven by greed  is leading2 
 us, rich and poor, strong and weak, to a catast rophe.  For, it is now evident  that 
these  challenges  have and continue  to inflict enormous  disruptive  impacts  on 
economies,  ecosystems and social  lives worldwi de, with Sub Saharan  African 
countries  and other developing  countries  being hit disprop ortionatel y.  
 
We have a famous proverb  in Kiswa hili which  says “Where  there are problems,  
ingenuity  increase s”. In this spirit, we in Tanzania are convinced that 
transformative  solutions  to the global challenges  we face, are already  at our 
disposal  but subject  to two conditions  being  met: First , there must be a 
passionate  belief  in the need to uphold  a caring  spirit about  needs  and happiness 
of other peoples  and nations;  and Second , there must be solemn  adherence  to 
the credo  of multilaterali sm and collaborative  effort.  Fortunately , both conditions  
are a restate ment of the ideals , values  and principles  of the United Nation s 
Charter . 
 
COVID -19 
 
Mr. President ; 
 
Specifically , on the COVID -19 pandemic , it had devastating  effects  on Tanzania’s 
socio-economic systems and performance . Just like  most other developing  
countr ies the pandemic robbed us of pr ecious lives, over stretched  health 
infrastructure  and healthcare  worke rs to the limit, led to severe budget 
constrai nts, as well as economic deceler ation.  Real GDP growth declined  from 
6.7 percent decadal growth attained in the pre-pandemic period , to 4.8 percent  
in 2020 .  
 
The key lesson  we have learned  from the COVID -19 pandemic is that, the 
world needs to be better pre pared in terms of national an d global health 
systems to be able to handle future  pandemics . This entails i nvesting  more  
in building health infras tructure and beef ing up the health workforce , as 
well as enhancing national and regional capac ity to manufact ure drugs, 
supplies , vaccines  and medical e quipment .  
 
In addition, Africa’s marginalization  in the provision  of vaccines  underscored  
the need for African Countr ies to work togeth er in the development and 
nurturing  of indigenous  solutions  through joint medical a nd scientific research . 
The pandemic also brought to the fore, the need to invest  more in public  health  
educati on especially  preventive  medicine  to build individual  resilien ce including  
body fitness,  healthy diet and habits .3 
 However,  I wish to acknowledge  that although  international  support  to Africa in 
taming the spread of the global  pandemic , through  provision  of diagnostic  
equipment , medicines,  vaccine  support  programs , and financing  came  late, it 
was critical  in winning  the war against the pandemic.  Therefore, Tanzania would 
like to thank all our development partners who have been worki ng with us  to 
deal with the pandemic and put the co untry on a brigh t post COVID -19 recovery 
path. Currently, the Government co ntinues with the  vaccination  campaign  
where by, as of 11th September, we had already vaccinated  60.56 percent  of the 
targeted p opulation. 
 
 
Climate  Change   
 
Mr. President ; 
 
With respect to climate change, we are indeed at a tipping point.  The United 
Republic of Tanzan ia appreciates all individual efforts and other collective 
measures taken thus far , in implementing interven tions geare d at upscaling 
mitigation and ad aptation as stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the 
Paris Agreement of 2015. However, despite the  efforts,  we are observing 
unprecedented change s across the whole climate system  in every region.  
 
The fac ts remain  that, the most vulnerable countri es including Tanzania , have 
been disproportionately affected  and nor do we possess the capacity to 
effecti vely respond.  Tanzania has put forward ambitious targets on both 
adaptation and mi tigation through National ly Determin ed Co ntributions 
(NDC s). The Government  spends  an average  of USD 500 million  per annum  on 
adaptation  measures  and up to 3 percent  of its GDP on mitigation  and building  
community  resilience.  With the help of the internati onal community, we are  
committed to continua lly update our NDCs and making important progress to 
tackle climate change.  
 
Yet, u nless there are immediate, rapid and  large-scale reductions in greenhouse 
gas emissions, limiting warming to at least  2°C will be  elusive . As muc h as w e 
remain comm itted, most of  the developing countries have  insufficient fiscal space 
and weak deb t sustainability status to address increasing  demand for climate 
resilient interventions.  Hence, a ddressing the climate crisis require s reliable 
access  to climate fina nce. It is on this note, that Tanzania call s on the 
international community to live up to its commitments made under the Paris 
Agreement . Enhanced capacity building, technology transfer, support for 
adaptation and mitigation me asures, as well  as the creation of independent 
loss and dam age financial facility must be implemented in order to scale up4 
 the fight against climate change . We need  to take actions and walk the talk  as 
a matter of urgency .  
 
 
 
I must, at this point, emphas ize that Tanzania and the rest o f Africa need a just 
transition f rom fossil fuels to rene wable energy .  Africa must be given time to 
adjust since the majority of Af ricans have no access to energy . The  well-
established  principle of common but di fferentiated  responsibilities an d respecti ve 
capabilities  must be observed .  In this re gard, we call upon the lifting of 
opposition to  global  financing and implementation of transformative  projects in 
our co untries that aim to  harness our hydrocarbon depo sits for ener gy and othe r 
equally imp ortant uses t o address our critical developmenta l needs . As long as 
robust E nvironmental Social and Impact Assessment s (ESIAs) have been done 
and con crete measures taken to effectively address envir onmental and 
democratic go vernance concerns of our citizens , our Soverei gn rights to pursue  
transformative pro jects should be respected . 
 
 
We also call up on transparency  in the conduct of carbon credit markets so that 
Africa ben efits fairly from our earnest  effort in taking care of the car bon sinks 
that we are hold ing for the world.  For example,  Tanzania has preserved over 30 
percent of the total land area almost equivalent to the  size of Germany which 
include s forest s and wildlife parks.  
 
International  Peace  and Security  
 
Mr. President ; 
 
In maintenance of peace and security,  Tanzania has always believed in 
diplomac y as the best instrument  of resolving conflicts. Experience has taught 
us that, in war, everyone loses,  including  the non -warring parties. It is 
therefore our plea that, in the wa ke of the global conflicts our focus should  
remain to be that of safeguarding huma n lives especially children and 
women and well -being of the people.  More so, just recently, w e have 
witnessed disruptive effects on global supply chain s, dramatic increase  in 
food and fuel pric es as well as food shortages  and decline in agricultural 
and i ndustrial production  around the world . All the more reasons that , we 
all must have a stake in pursuit of peaceful resolution of conflicts.  As we do 
so, we must al so leverage  our abundant  resources  and human  capabiliti es to 
address  some  of the impact s.  
 
Mr. President ; 
 
In the same spirit, Peacekeeping operation s remai n one of the most 
dependable instrument s for promoting world peace and security. Tanzania is5 
 proud to have cont ributed men and women in 5 out of the existing 1 
peacekeeping missions across the world. Despite th is state of affairs,  
Tanzania stands re ady to  contribute more, if requested to do so.  We also 
continue to actively participat e in regional peace initiatives  and more so now in 
our capacity as a member of the African Union Peace and Security Council  as 
well as  EAC and SADC . Hence, we call upon th e United Nations to enhance its 
support to the regional efforts in peace building and peace keeping.  
 
Security Counc il Re forms  
 
Mr. President,  
The credibility of the United Nations rests on a well-represented  and 
respon sive Securit y Council. We, therefore wish to reit erate, the common 
African position, as elaborated in  the Ez ulwini Consensus and the Sirte 
Declaration wi th respect to the long-awaited  reforms of the Security Council.  
It is well pas t time the United Nations  Security Council reflected the present-
day realities of the United Nations Membersh ip and not that of the 1940s.  
 
Conclusion  
 
Mr. President ; 
It would be  remis s of me to end my statement without  acknowled ging that, the 
world celebrated Kiswahili Language for the first time this year on 7th July, 
following the historic d eclaration of the United Nations Educ ational and Scientific 
Organization (UNESCO)  design ating “7 July” as t he World Kiswahili Lan guage 
Day. As the birthplace of the Kiswahili language, Tanzania commends the efforts 
of the United Nati ons in promoting multil ingualism as a core value , essential i n 
achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Develo pment and the Africa n Union 
Agenda 2063.   
 
To conclu de, let me,  once again , reaffirm the resolve of the United Republic of 
Tanzania to uphold the three pillars of the United Nations  namely; peace and 
security, development and human rights . I also call upon all of us to renew  our 
commitment  and prioritization  of actions  especially  on those  SDGS  where  we lag 
far behind.  We remain committed to working closely with the United Nations and 
its Member  States , in the spirit of multilateralism and global solidar ity towards a 
sustainable future.  
 
 
I thank you .", TZA,2022

AT THE  
 
GENERAL  DEBATE  OF THE 77TH SESSION  OF THE UNITED

[Please  check  against  delivery ] The President  of the UN General  Assembly;  
Excellencies,  Heads  of State  and Government;  
The Secretary -General  of United  Nations;  
Distinguished  delegates;  
Ladies  and Gentlemen.  
 
Mr. President,   
 
I congratulate  you on your election  as President  of the 77th 
Session  of the UN General  Assembly  and assure  you of 
Uganda’s  full support.  I would  like to thank  H.E. Mr. Abdulla  
Shahid  for his stewardship  of the 76th Session . I pay tribute  
to the Secretary -General,  H.E. António  Guterres,  for his 
commitment  to the work  of the United  Nations.   
 
This Session  is being  held in-person  for the first time since  
2020  when  the COVID19  pandemic  made  it impossible.     It 
is a timely  reminder  of the urgent  need to strengthen  
international  cooperation,  collaboration  and solidarity  for 
the world  to take transformative  actions  to address  the 
comm on challenge s that include ; poverty,  health  
pandemic s, climate  change,  food insecurity  and biodiversity  
loss among  others .   
As we celebrate  seventy -seven  years  of the United  Nations,  
we need a revitalized  organization  that is fit for purpose.     We 
need this organization  stronger  than before.   We believe  that 
multilateralism  is fundamental  and crucial  in addressing  
our common  challenges.   We believe  that by acting  together  
as nations  in solidarity,  the world  can effectively  address  the 
current  and emerging  challenges. Responding to COVID19 has taught us a lot. We should 
scale up cooperation in vaccine production capacity and 
resource mobilization , to support efforts to mitigate the 
impact of COVID19 .  We are tha nkful to our bilateral and 
multilateral partners that supported our respon se to the 
COVID19 challenge.    
 
Mr. President,  
 
The Government  of Uganda  attaches  importance  to the 2030  
Agenda  for Sustainable  Development  and continues  to 
register  progress  in its implementation.    It has continued  to 
strengthen  institutional  coordination  to achieve  the 
seventeen  (17) Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  and 
the National  SDG Secretariat  has been strengthened  to 
support  the coordination  architecture , to ensure  that the 
country  stays  on track in implementing  the SDGs.    
  
The Government  has fully mainstreamed  the SDGs  in the 
National  Development  Plan and is working  together  with the 
UN family  and other  stakeholders .   This will sustain  and 
strengthen  collaboration  with all actors .  However,  effective  
implementation  of the agenda  will require  support  in areas  
such as transfer  of technology,  capacity  building  and 
financing.     
Mr. President,  
 
Climate  change  remains  one of the greatest  challenges  of our 
time.  Our collective  effort  to fight climate  change  is an 
irreversible  process  that must  continue.   However,  we must note that despite  contributing  an insignificant  amount  of 
global  greenhouse  gas emissions,  the African  continent  like 
many  developing  regions  of the world  suffer  the effects  of 
climate  change  to a disproportionate  degree.    Uganda , for 
instance  continues  to experience  prolonged  droughts,  
melting  of ice caps at its highest  mountain,  Mt. Ruwenzori,  
floods,  erratic  rainfall  patterns  and landslides .  
 
But l ike His Excellency President Museveni has said , the 
climate problem is also a result of irresp onsible and 
sometimes greedy human actions .    Likewise,  if under -
development persists, we should forget about conserving the 
environment.  It is regrettable and hypocritical that some of 
the regions and nations that mismanaged the environment 
and are disproportionately responsible for global warming, 
have embarked on a rigorous campaign to thwart efforts of 
other countr ies, to responsibly and sustainably develop the  
oil and gas sec tors.    Our view is that development should 
be environmentally friendly, inclusive and provide benefits 
for all  – it should leave  no one behind.    
 
 
 
Uganda has continued  to scale up investments in climate 
adaptation and mitigation measures , in particular , 
increasing access to clean energy to enhance production, 
and increasing forest and wetland cover, among other  
interventions .   Climate change  actions must uphold the 
principle of equity and common but differentiated 
responsibilities, consistent with  national context .  We, 
therefore urge the developed countries in line with the Paris Agreement to fully deliver on the USD 100 billion goal 
commitments per year, to assi st developing countries in 
their climate change actions to mitigate the adverse effects .   
 
Mr. President,  
 
South -South Cooperation, a framework  of international 
cooperation within the global south , continues to play a vital 
role in supporting d eveloping c ountries in their efforts to 
address interlocking challenges. We applaud countries in 
the global south for their solidarity in responding to global 
challenges .   Uganda will continue to work and support the  
strengthen ing of the North -South, South -South  and 
Triangular Cooperation within the United Nations .   As host 
of the Third South Summit, we look forward to welcoming 
the leaders of the Group of 77 and China to Kampala, 
Uganda,  from 10th to 12th December 2023.     
 
Mr. President,  
 
The world  is currently  facing  many  challenges  that 
undermine    international  peace  and security.   The Russia -
Ukraine  military  conflict  continues  to cause  more  suffering , 
destruction  and displacement  of the civilian  population,  
mostly  women  and children.  The longer  it persists,  the more  
suffering,  destruction  and displacement  we shall witness.    
We are deeply  concerned  about  the loss of lives and the 
serious  humanitarian  situation.    Uganda  supports  dialogue  
with a view to reaching  a peaceful  resolution  to the crisis .    
My President  has said many  times,  ""We think  the best way 
is to negotiate.  Everybody  who wants  peace  in the world should  support  negotiations  in order  to get balanced  peace  
that ensures  safety  for all"". 
Mr. President,  
 
Terrorism is one of the major  threats to peace, security and 
stability, as well as social and economic development in the 
world today.     No region of the world has been safe from the 
scourge of terrorism.  Terrorism and violent extremism 
continue to bring death and suffering to inno cent people. 
Terrorist groups such as Al -Shabaab an d the Allied 
Democratic Forces (ADF) , continue to commit terrorist acts 
in our region .  As a community of nations, we must be 
unwavering in our resolve to prevent and combat terrorism, 
in all its forms and  manifestations .  We should act in a 
coordinated manner at the national, regional and global level  
to counter this threat.    Uganda,  will continue to support 
and actively participate in global and regional counter -
terrorism efforts.     
 
 
Mr. President,  
 
Peace, security and development are inextricably linked and 
should be pursued simultaneously.  In the recent period we 
have seen some progress in our quest for  peace and security 
in our region . Uganda working with partners in the region 
and beyond continues to support and advance peace and 
security efforts in the region.  We remain actively involved in 
regional initiatives such as those of the African Union (AU), 
the Intergovernmental Authority on Devel opment (IGAD), East African Community (EAC), International Conference on 
the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), and are encouraged by the 
progress that we continue to make.  We believe that long 
term and sustainable solution s lie in these  collaborative 
process es.   
 
The international  community  and the United  Nations  in 
particular  should  therefore  continue  to support  conflict  
prevention  initiatives  undertaken  by these  regional  and sub-
regional  organizations.   Experience  has shown  that when  
and where  this happen ed the chances  of success  have been 
high.   
 
The conflicts  in our region  and beyond  have led to an 
inevitable  refugee  influx  into Uganda.   Currently,  we have 
over 1.5 million  refugees  in the country .    The largest  refugee  
population  on the continent  of Africa  and third largest  in the 
world.   We are committed  to working  with refugee  sending  
countries , regional  and international  partners  to address  the 
causes  of the refugee  crises.     We urge the international  
community  to continue  support ing our efforts  in the region . 
 
Mr. President,  
 
The need to reform  the UN Security  Council  is now more  
urgent  and imperative  than ever before.    The present  
geopolitical  realities  are more  compelling  for a 
comprehensive  reform  of the Security  Council  to make  way 
for equitable  representation.   Africa  with more  than one 
billion  citizens,  and with over seventy  percent  of issues  on 
the agenda  of the Council,  continues  to suffer  the historical injustice  of having  no representation  in the Permanent  
category  of the Secur ity Council,  and is under -represented  
in the non-Permanent  category  too.   
 
It is time this long-standing  injustice  and imbalance,  
perpetuated  in the present  configuration  of the Security  
Council,  is addressed .    Uganda  supports  the 
comprehensive  reform  of the UN Security  Council  and we 
urge Member  States to continue  work ing towards achieving  
progress  in the Intergovernmental  Negotiations  (IGN),  so that 
Africa  can assume  its rightful  place  in the Security  Council.    
 
Mr. President,  
 
The Non-Aligned  Movement  (NAM)  remains  a strong  pillar  in 
addressing  the global  challenges  within  the United  Nations .    
We remain  actively  involved  in the NAM, in line with its

Mr. President of the General Assembly  
Mr. Secretary General  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
In 1945, delegates from 51 countries met in San 
Francisco to found the United Nations.  
They made a commitment to maintain 
international peace and security, develop friendly 
relations among nations, and ""spare future 
generations the scourge of war.""  
77 ye ars later, we still haven't achieved these 
goals. Around the world, many children - and even 
many adults - have never known peace. 
 
In Europe today we are confronted with the 
unjustified and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, in 
flagrant violation of international law, primarily of 
the United Nations Charter.  
A war with devastating effects for the Ukrainian 
people, brutally affecting the  civilian populations.  
The gravity of the acts committed makes an 
independent, impartial and transparent 
investigation imperative so that the crimes 
committed do not go unpunished.  
We cannot, therefore, fail to condemn once again 
the Russian aggression an d here to reinforce 
Portugal's support for the sovereignty, 
independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine.  
Russia must cease hostilities and allow for the 
creation of a serious and sustained ceasefire - and 
peace -oriented dialogue.  
This is not the tim e for Russia to escalate the 
conflict or to make irresponsible threats to resort 
to nuclear weapons. 
 
We welcome the efforts of the entire United Nations 
system, in particular its Secretary -General, to 
resolve this conflict and to mitigate its damaging 
effects, such as the food crisis.  
Once again, it has been the most vulnerable who 
have felt the impact of the energy and food crisis 
the most, after being buffeted by almost three 
years of health crisis.  
That is why we reiterate our solidarity with all 
those a round the world - and particularly in Africa 
- who are suffering from the impact of Russia's 
invasion of Ukraine.  
And that is also why it is important to make it clear 
and unequivocal that the necessary sanctions 
applied to Russia cannot affect, directly o r 
indirectly, the production, transportation and 
payment of cereals and fertilizers.  
 
Excellencies, 
 
Peace was not definitively won in 1945, but the 
world has changed radically since then.  
We need a representative, agile and functional 
Security Council that  is able to respond to the 
challenges of the 21st century without becoming 
paralyzed, and whose actions are scrutinized by 
the other members of the United Nations.  
A Security Council that incorporates a 
comprehensive view of security, recognizing, inter 
alia, the role of climate change as an accelerant of 
conflict.  
A Security Council where the African continent, 
and at least Brazil and India, have seats. And 
where small countries are more fairly represented.  
A global vision of security is essential, with the New 
Agenda for Peace advocated by the Secretary 
General. An agenda focused on conflict prevention 
and capable of ensuring adequate, predictable, 
and sustainable funding for peacebuilding. 
 
As an international community, it is our duty to 
support the eff orts of the African nations for the 
stability of their continent, seeking African 
solutions to African problems.  
The worsening security and humanitarian context 
in the Sahel also requires a concerted and 
multidimensional effort, ensuring humanitarian 
assistance to populations affected by the multiple 
crises that plague the region.  
The evolving terrorist threat around the world, but 
particularly in Mozambique, the Sahel and the 
Gulf of Guinea, requires a targeted and effective 
response from states.  
It is i mportant to address the root causes that 
contribute to radicalization, such as the collapse of 
state structures, human rights violations, social 
exclusion, and inequality.  
Over the past decades, my country has established 
itself as a reliable partner for global peace and 
stability. 
 
Currently, at the service of the United Nations, we 
are present in four theaters of peacekeeping 
operations, namely in MINUSCA.  
I am very proud of the recognition our military and 
security forces have received for their contri bution 
to crisis and conflict management on all continents 
- under the aegis of the United Nations, NATO or 
the European Union.   
Excellencies,  
It is undeniable that there is a link between climate 
and security.  
Today, more than ever, we are feeling the effects of 
climate change - heat waves or intense cold, 
droughts, fires, floods and storms.  
Countries like Portugal, which suffer from coastal 
erosion, increased droughts, and the drama of 
forest fires, clearly understand the urgency of 
climate action. 
 
Nor is it necessary to explain it to countries like 
Pakistan, which is today suffering the tru ly 
devastating consequences of the rest of the world's 
climate inaction.  
Or to coastal countries, particularly small island 
nations, which are feeling their livelihoods 
threatened year after year by rising sea waters.  
We hope that COP -27 in Sharm -el-Sheik can be a 
moment that leads to an inclusive transition, 
ensuring a more balanced allocation of climate 
finance between mitigation and adaptation.  
Portugal has been at the forefront of the 
decarbonization process, having been the first to 
commit to achievi ng carbon neutrality by 2050, as 
early as COP 22 in Marrakech.  
We believe that this goal is feasible from an 
economic and technological point of view, a 
promoter of employment and a generator of social 
justice. 
 
We will seek to accelerate these commitment s as 
we have already done with our goal of ending 
electricity production through coal, which we 
achieved last year.  
By 2026, we want to increase from 60% to 80% the 
weight of renewables in the electricity consumed.  
To this end, we will continue the strong  investment 
we have been making in solar, wind, and ocean 
energies, and invest in the use of renewable gases 
such as green hydrogen.  
Excellencies,  
The sea is one of the platforms where climate is 
projected.  
We welcome the active participation of all Stat es in 
the second Oceans Conference, which we had the 
honor of co -organizing with Kenya.  
The Lisbon Declaration constitutes a real action 
plan for achieving SDG 14 on the conservation and 
sustainable use of ocean resources. 
 
As part of the commitments made b y the various 
countries and entities present, Portugal also 
reiterated its commitment to protect at least 30% 
of marine areas by 2030.  
We went further - by then we want 100% of the 
maritime space under Portuguese sovereignty or 
jurisdiction to be assessed  as being in good 
environmental status.  
After Lisbon, there is still a lot of work to do on the 
ocean agenda and I am sure that France and Costa 
Rica will pursue this mission with redoubled 
energy.  
We therefore call for the conclusion of negotiations 
on a post -2020 Global Biodiversity Framework 
that enshrines the 30 by 30 goal.  
We also advocate progress in the negotiations of 
the treaty on Marine Biodiversity in Areas Beyond 
National Jurisdictions by the end of this year.  
Excellencies, 
 
The transition to a prosperous future - a green and 
digital future - ""can leave no one behind"". Social 
policies must be at the heart of our action, of the 
development of our economies, of the fight against 
climate change.  
We therefore support the preparatory process for 
the Social Summit proposed by the Secretary -
General.  
We must also continue to work to ensure effective 
and equitable immunization worldwide, improve 
the global health architecture, and find ways to 
respond more quickly, in a coordinated and 
decisive manner t o future crises by adopting a 
Pandemic Treaty.  
The success of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development Goals' implementation plays mainly 
on the most vulnerable countries and populations.  
All these challenges highlight even more the 
universal, indivisi ble and independent nature of all 
human rights, whose respect, protection and 
 
promotion are a top priority of Portugal's external 
and internal action.  
Imbued with the humanist spirit that our 
historical responsibility as forerunners of the 
abolition of the death penalty imposes on us, we 
will continue to fight for its universal abolition.  
No future will be truly transformative without 
pluralist, inclusive societies that promote gender 
equality and combat racial discrimination, racism, 
xenophobia , and all forms of intolerance.  
The fight for gender equality and women's 
empowerment is, in this respect, absolutely 
crucial. Without winning i t, it is not possible to 
meet our human rights obligations or the 
successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development.  
It is also crucial that we pay particular attention to 
the impact of conflict situations on the rights of 
women and girls and the fundamental role that 
 
they can play in peace -building and consolidation 
processes.  
I therefore want to reiterate our support for the 
Women, Peace and Security Agenda of the United 
Nations.  
 
Excellencies,  
As a country of emigration and immigr ation, we 
will continue to participate constructively in 
discussions on the global governance of migration.  
And we will continue the good path that we have 
been following on national territory, from the 
integration of migrants to the promotion of regular 
pathways for labor mobility.  
We have played an active role in welcoming 
migrants and refugees, in a clear expression of 
solidarity, having welcomed refugees from Ukraine 
and Afghanistan, among others. 
 
Excellencies,  
The transformative potential of the Unit ed Nations 
is immense - but it must be given the tools to 
realize the high expectations placed in it by people 
around the world, particularly young people.  
One third of the world's population is under 20. It 
is therefore essential to ensure that young peo ple 
participate in decision -making processes and that 
their voices are effectively heard.  
We will therefore continue to take a leading role in 
the Youth agenda and support the work of the UN 
Office for Youth.  
Excellencies,  
The United Nations is the global forum for 
consultation among peoples.  
The challenges we face today make it unavoidable 
that we must continue to adapt our common 
home, making it more efficient, fairer, and more 
representative. 
 
Portugal is ready to make its contribution. We are 
candidate s to the Security Council for the 
biennium 2027 -28. We hope once again to deserve 
your confidence because only together, all 
countries, involving civil societies, can we build a 
more peaceful, more sustainable and more 
inclusive future.  
The strengthening o f multilateralism is not an 
option. It is an absolute necessity in order to face 
global challenges.  
It is time to move from words to action - with more 
cooperation, more solidarity, and more 
multilateralism.  
Portugal will not miss this call.", PRT,2022

 THE STATEMENT OF PRIME MINISTER NIKOL PASHINYAN AT 
THE GENERAL DEBATE OF THE 77TH SESSION AT THE UNITED 
NATION S GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
New York , September  22, 2022  
           
Mr. President,  
Excellences,  
Ladies and g entlemen,  
 
It is an honor  to return to the General Assembly, though  I wish I 
was here with a more positive message, given all the challenges and 
tribulations  the world has been through in the past few years.  
But my statement will focus on the latest Azerbaijani  unprovoked 
aggression against the sovereign territory of the Republic of  Armenia 
and its overall impact on  the stability in  the South Caucasus .  
On September  13, Azerbaijan launched an unprovoked and 
unjustified military aggression against Armenia. Using heavy artillery, 
Multiple Rocket Launchers and combat UAVs, the Azerbaijani armed 
forces shelled  36 residential areas and communities, including  towns of 
Goris, Jermuk, Vardenis, Kapan, Geghamasar  deep within the sovereign 
territory of Armenia . This was not a border clash. It was a direct , 
undeniable  attack against the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of 
Armenia , which was condemned and addressed during the latest UN 
Security Council meeting s and beyond .   
The Azerbaijani attack deliberately targeted civilian  population 
and vital civilian infrastructures: Jermuk is  one of the main health  
tourism and resort place s of Armenia and now as a result of Azerbaijani 
aggression all the hotels, resort  and health centers  of Jermuk are closed. 
All the residents  of this town are displaced. Overall number of those 
 temporarily displaced from Gegharkunik, Vayots Dzor, and Syunik 
regions of Armenia is more than 7600  persons, mostly women and 
elderly people, among them 1437 children and 99 persons with 
disabilities.  
 
Around 192 houses, 3 hotels, 2 schools, 1 medical facility,  1 
medical facility, partially or completely destroyed. 7 electrical 
infrastructures, 5 water infrastructures, 3 gas pipelines, 1 bridge were 
damaged. 2 ambulances, 4 private cars  were shelled . The Kechut water 
reservoir was targeted and shelled. Journalists and ambulance vehicles 
were targeted and s helled  as well .   
 
As a result of the aggression, the number of victims and missing 
persons at the moment exceeded 207, among them  3 civilians were 
killed  and 2 civilians are missing . 293 servicemen and 8 civilians were 
wounded, at least 20 servicemen were captured. There are evidences of 
cases of torture, mutilation of captured or already dead servicemen , 
numerous instances of extra -judicial killings, and ill -treatment of 
Armenian prisoners of war, as well as humiliating treatment of the 
bodies. The dead bodies of Armenian female military personnel were 
mutilated and then “proudly” video -recorded with particular cruelty by 
the Azerbaijani servicemen. The videos featuring such gruesome war 
crimes and crimes against humanity are being shared an d praised on 
Azerbaijani social media by individual users.  
No doubt, committing  such unspeakable atrocities is a direct re sult 
of decades long pol icy of implanting anti -Armenian hatred and 
animosity  in the Azerbaijani society by the political leadership.  
In the wake of  this offensive, the official narrative and other 
sources of information suggest that Azerbaijan intends  to occupy more  
territories  of Armenia , which needs to be prevented . I want to stress 
that the risk of new aggression by Azerbaijan remains very high, 
especially taking into account that every day Azerbaijan violat es the 
 ceasefire, and the number of causalities and those in jured could change 
any moment. Another factor fo r further esc alation can be in appropriate 
reaction to this situation by the  regional security organizations , which 
raised very hard questions among Armenian society.     
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Despite the above -mentioned facts Azerbaijan is trying to pose 
itself as a country  seeking peace in our region, peace with Armenia. 
Hearing from aside what Azerbaijan is saying, you can even  be 
impressed by its  devotion  to peace  efforts . And for staging this 
impressio n Azerbaijan is using the subjects of Peace treaty with 
Armenia , border delimitation, and regional communication opening 
agenda.  
Why we have no tangible progress in  these directions . The reason 
is very simple. Azerbaijan is using all those topics for territorial claims 
against Armenia. For exam ple – one of the most important subjects  of 
peace treaty is bilateral recognition of territorial integrity between 
Armenia and Azerbaijan. We have already declared that we are  ready to 
do so, but Azerbaijan  hasn’t  done it so far. On the contrary,  Azerbaijan 
has been publicly voicing  that the entire South and East of Armenia and 
even the capital city of Yerevan, is an Azerbaijani land. On the  other 
hand , Azerbaij an is keeping under occupation tangible  territories of 
Armenia, and as I said the risk of new aggression by Azerbaijan remains 
very h igh. 
In this regard I’m posing an official and public question to the 
Azerbaijani president. Could you show the map of Armenia, that you 
recognize or are ready to recognize as the Republic of Armenia? Why 
I’m asking this. Because it can come out that from the point of view of 
official Azerbaijan only half of Armenia and even less - is the Republic 
of Armenia. If Azerbaijan would  recognize territorial integrity of 
 Armenia, not theoretically , but concrete ly, I mean the integrity of our 
internationally recognized  territory of  29.800  square kilometer s, it 
would mean that we can sign peace treaty  by mutually recognizing each 
other’s territorial integrity . Otherwise, we would have a phantom peace 
treaty and after that A zerbaijan will use  border delimitation process for 
new territorial claims  and occupation .  
As you may know bilateral commission of border delimitation and 
border security was formed in May and two meeting s of the commission 
have taken  place. Before the formation of the commission , last year  
Azerbaijan occupied more than 40 square kilometer territories of 
Armenia. And then, one of the excuses  of Azerbaijan  about the reasons  
they ha ve done this  - was that Armenia , according to them , refus es to 
form border delimitation commission. Of course we didn’t  refus e to do 
that but only insisted that  simultaneously a  mechanism of border 
security should be established.  
In the end, according to our international partners’  request , who 
argued that the border commission work itself will be  a reliable factor 
for border security , we agreed to start the work . And now that  border 
delimitation and security commission  has been  formed and is working, 
Azerbaijan initiated  a new phase of aggression . And some of those 
international partners are silent.  But what is now the explanation for 
aggression of Azerbaijan. You know, i f someone has excess of 
aggressiveness the reason always will be there. As it is said in a movie it 
is always possible to find a reason. For example, why they killed prince 
Hamlet. Who killed, how, when and why – it doesn’t matter. The 
reality is that Azerbaijan is tryi ng and will continue to use delimitation 
process for territorial claims against Armenia.   
Another such a topic is  the opening of  regional transport 
communication links. Azerbaijan is trying to represent Armenia as a 
 destructive side in this discussion. The reality is , that Armenia is ready  
to open its roads for Azerbaijan in the framework of our national 
legislation. Moreover, recently the draft decision of government was 
published, that  suppos es to open three  check points  in the border with 
Azerbaijan for implementation of the article 9 of the trilateral statement 
from November 9, 2020. According to that draft, citizens and goods of 
Azerbaijan would be eligible to use the existing roads of Armenia to 
commute from main Azer baijan to the Nak hchivan  Autonomous 
Republic. The Armenian government had political will to unilaterally  
accept that decision. But Azerbaijani officials tell us , that they don’ t 
want to have those routes. What do they want? They want  a new route 
to be constructed . It is also acceptable for Armenia, but according to the 
9th article of the trilateral statement from November 9, 2020, a new 
route can be constructed with the consent  of the sides. Armenia is ready 
to construct such a route which would operate according to the 
legislation and within sovereign control of the Republic of Armenia .     
So what is the point of Azerbaijan i claims ? Azerbaijan is hinting 
that Armenia has to provide an extraterritorial corridor and  according 
to them  the 9th article  of the trilateral statement from  November  9, 2020  
is supposed to do that. The trilateral statement is a public document and 
in the 9th article there is nothing about  corridor, extraterritoriality etc.  
So what is the purpose of Azerbaijan? To create a new crisis  as a pretext  
for a new aggression against Armenia and for a new territorial claim.  
We have shared  packages of proposal s with  Azerbaijan on the  
topic  of opening communications , and if Azerbaijan  accept s that those 
route s must operate according to national legislations, we can decide on 
this very quickly.  
By the way, the trilateral statements from Novem ber 9, 2020 and 
January 11, 2021 i mply that not only Armenia should provide roads to 
 Azerbaijan, but Azerbaijan should provide roads to Armenia  too. And 
we haven’t received anything so far  either .  
As for the corridor wording , it is very important to note  that in the 
trilateral statement from November 9, only one corridor is mentioned , 
and it is the Lachin corridor for Nagorno -Karabakh .  
 
Ladies and gentleman,   
One of the crucial factors of regional stability is the comprehensive 
settlement of the Nagorno -Karabakh conflict where the rights and the 
security of the Armenians living in NK will be addressed and 
guaranteed.  
Latest aggression is happening while the hu manitarian consequences of 
the 2020 war in Nagorno -Karabakh have not been addressed yet. The 
post-war rehabilitation of Nagorno -Karabakh, the psycho-social issues 
of the displaced population, the repatriation of Armenian POW’s and 
the preservation of cultu ral and religious heritage remain on the agenda 
of our Government.   
Nevertheless, the Armenians in  Nagorno -Karabakh are in need of 
the support of the international community. We call to support the 
secure and unhindered access of UN humanitarian agencies to Nagorno -
Karabakh in order to assess the humanitarian, human rights situation 
and ensure  protection of cultural heritage on the ground. We think that 
the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the 
independent fact -finding mission of UNESCO should have access to the 
Nagorno -Karabakh conflict zone.   
Unfortunately, Azerbaijan has be en blocking both missions by 
making artificial, political preconditions, essentially blocking the access 
of an independent fact -finding mission in Nagorno -Karabakh. 
 It is also reprehensible that Azerbaijan stalls  the repatriation of 
Armenian Prisoners of War, inter alia subjecting them to artificial trials 
in gross violation of international humanitarian law, its own 
commitments, and contrary to the calls of the international community.  
 
Mr. President,  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
Sustainable regional peace and stability is our objective. Last year 
through democratic snap elections our people strongly supported the 
peace agenda of the Government and re -confirmed the commitment of 
Armenia to pursue the democratic path . 
It is very important to state that the target of Azerbaijani attacks 
isn’t only the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
Armenia, but democracy of Armenia too. Despite the expectation of 
some forces Armenia stayed democratic after devasta ting war of 2020, 
using the tool of free fair and democratic elections as a way out from 
internal political crisis. International community unanimously  
recognized and praised  this fact.  
The Armenian  democracy is struggling  in an atmosphere, when 
Azerbaijan  is using force every day, to impose its plans unilaterally, to 
bring to the end the Armenian statehood, independence and 
democracy.    
But I’m here to announce that we are determined to defend our 
democracy, independence, sovereignty and terri torial integrity by all 
means. I want to underscore  that diplomatic solutions are an absolute 
priority for us and the full engagement and support of in ternational 
community is crucial. In  this regard I would like to mention , that the 
 internat ional observation  mission to the Armenia -Azerbaijan bordering 
areas would be an important factor for regional stability.  
  Undeniably, in the interests of regional stability and in accordance 
with  norms and principles  of international law Azerbaijani military 
forces  must be withdrawn  from the sovereign territory of the Republic 
of Armenia.  
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to stress again: we are determined to 
build peace in our region, but we need the full support of  international 
community, which will stand by the sovereign  and democratic  country 
and people subjected to aggression against the norms and principles of 
international law.  
I believe in the potential of establishing long -term stability, 
security and peace and Armenia is committed to continuing diplomatic 
efforts to this end.  
I thank you for your attention.", ARM,2022
 IRL_77_2022,"National Statement of Ireland  
to the United Nations  
General Assembly  
by Taoiseach Micheál Martin  
22 September 2022  
 
  
President of the General Assembly, Distinguished Heads of State and Government, 
Secretary -General, Excellencies, Friends,  
This year, Ireland marks the centenary of our independence.  
The Irish Free State was established on the 6th of December, 1922 and we began our journey as an independent, sovereign nation.  
From the start of this journey, we were a nation that looked outwards.  
One of our first acts was to apply to join the League of Nations.  
In his first address to the Assembly of the League of Nations the following year, then President of the Irish Government’s Executive Council, W.T. Cosgrave, spoke of Ireland’s commitment to ‘avert the ancient evils of warfare and oppression; to encourage wholesome, and to discourage unwholesome relations between nation and nation; to enable even the weakest of nations to live their own lives and make their own proper contribution to the good of  all, free even from the shadow and the fear of external 
violence, vicious penetration, or injurious pressure of any kind.’  
These are the ideals that guide Ireland’s foreign policy.  
These same principles, articulated one hundred years ago, as the League’s newest member, continue to inform our actions today.  
The belief that all countries have an equal right to live in peace.  
That all countries, no matter how small, have a contribution to make to international peace and security, and to economic and social de velopment.That all people have the right to live in dignity; to have their human rights and 
fundamental freedoms respected.  
President, Excellencies  
One hundred years on, we, as a global community, are very far from living up to these principles.  
We convene here at a time of crisis.  
A time when, yet again, we are facing the threat of widespread global hunger and food insecurity.  
When we see daily the devastating impacts of climate change, with those who bear no responsibility for its causes being most affec ted. 
When we have witnessed the most blatant disregard for international law and for the UN Charter on my own home continent of Europe.  
When much of the progress that we were making towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals has stalled or gone into reverse, as we grapple with the continued effects of the COVID -19 pandemic.  
It does not have to be this way.  
We have the tools and the systems to address these issues.  
We have – in this General Assembly, and in the other bodies, institutions and agencies 
that make up the United Nations – the spaces to discuss, to negotiate, to share 
experiences, to craft solutions.  
We have an interlocking web of Charters, of Treaties, of norms, of resolutions, of international juris prudence, of political declarations, of agreed conclusions.  
Our global structures are not perfect – we know that.  
No structures ever are.  
There is much that needs reform.  
But it is not our systems or our structures, nor our Treaties or Charters, that are fundamentally failing us . 
It is the lack of political will to implement and uphold them.  
President, Excellencies  
I opened by quoting a former Irish Leader speaking to the League of Nations Assembly, almost 100 years ago.  
Let me quote another Irish Leader and former President of I reland, Eamon de Valera, 
also speaking to the League of Nations, exactly 90 years ago today.De Valera believed in the League’s potential to protect small nations through collective 
security.  
But he recognized that, to be effective, the League Covenant had  to be enforced; 
member states had to fulfil their obligations.  
In his speech in September 1932, he warned that world opinion was losing faith in the capacity of the League to protect peace and stability.  
“People are complaining that the League is devoting  its activity to matters of secondary 
or very minor importance, while the vital international problems of the day… are being shelved or postponed or ignored”.  
90 years on, we cannot continue to shelve or postpone or ignore our existential global challenges . 
President, Excellencies  
As an elected member of the Security Council, Ireland has seen first- hand that political 
will, and a commitment to the principles of the UN Charter, can deliver results.  
On Syria, Ireland has worked in partnership with Norway, and  with all Council members, 
to ensure that humanitarian aid can continue to reach the millions who need it.  
During our eighteen months on the Council, we have twice renewed the UN cross -
border operation, which provides crucial aid to four million people in the North West of the country. Ireland will continue to work to keep that critical lifeline open. We urge other members of the Council to support a further renewal. To do otherwise would have 
devastating consequences for the people of Syria.  
We have worked  with our partners on the Council to extend, and renew, the mandates 
of the 14 UN peacekeeping operations, and the many UN Special Political Missions, that require the approval of the Council.  
Day after day, across the globe, the military and civilian pers onnel in these missions 
protect civilians, monitor ceasefires, support peace building, facilitate negotiations and verify the implementation of peace agreements.  
Amongst them are hundreds of Irish men and women, who carry on our proud tradition of peacekeeping and crisis management.  
We are deeply proud of their service.  
Echoing that tradition, last year, Ireland led work on Resolution 2594, the Council’s first ever resolution on Peacekeeping Transitions.  
Adopted with the support of all Council members, it w ill help to ensure that the hard -
won gains of peace are maintained when a peacekeeping mission ends.It puts the protection of civilians at the centre of the UN’s planning, when transitioning 
from military peacekeeping operations into civilian -led politica l missions, in countries 
emerging from conflict.  
We have also seen progress on the Women, Peace and Security agenda.  
As co- chair along with Mexico of the Council’s expert group, Ireland has ensured that 
the role of women as peacebuilders, and as agents of change, is at the heart of UN 
peacekeeping and political missions across the globe.  
We have brought the voice of grassroots women peacebuilders to the Council table, with a record 16 women civil society briefers during our Presidency of the Council last September.  
Our commitment to the protection of civilians has also informed our work in leading negotiations to agree a Political Declaration on the use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas earlier this year.  
This Declaration is a significant milestone, which recognises the humanitarian consequences of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, and includes a number of ambitious actions to address those impacts.  
I look forward to its formal adoption at a high -level international conference in Dublin on 
18 November.  
President, Excellencies  
We have been encouraged by these successes, incremental though some of them are.  
But at times we have also been deeply frustrated by the Security Council’s failure to act . 
A year ago, I stood before you and spoke of our ambition for the Council to adopt a resolution on Climate and Security.  
Along with Niger, we worked tirelessly to craft a resolution that reflected the reality that climate change is increasingly driving in security and acting as a threat multiplier.  
We challenged the Council to take on its responsibilities to address the impact of climate change on international peace and security.  
One hundred and thirteen countries – one hundred and thirteen of the Members of this 
Assembly – supported us in our efforts.  
One country -  Russia - vetoed these efforts.  
It frankly beggars belief that, in 2022, the UN body charged with the maintenance of peace and security, has still not taken on its responsibilities in this area. It is a singular failure of political will and political responsibility.  
A year ago, I also spoke to you of Ireland’s deep concern at the situation in Tigray, in northern Ethiopia -  at the looming humanitarian catastrophe, at the violations of human 
rights  and international humanitarian law.I spoke of the vital need for a negotiated ceasefire, unfettered humanitarian access and 
the restoration of basic services, and a political solution to the crisis.  
Yet, a year later, we continue to raise the alarm. We c ontinue to urge the Council to act 
decisively. We continue with our determination to support a political solution and seek accountability for gross human rights abuses.  
President, Excellencies  
Each month, the Council meets to discuss the situation in Pales tine. 
Each month, Ireland, along with many of our fellow members of the Council, has reiterated our firm commitment to a two -State solution, with a viable Palestinian state 
based on 1967 borders, living in peace and security alongside the State of Israel, with Jerusalem as the capital of both states.  
But we are no nearer today to that aim than we were when we joined the Council 18 months ago; and, truth be told, long before that.  
Israeli settlement building continues to undermine – it would seem knowingly a nd 
deliberately - the viability and territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian State, and to 
jeopardise the two -State solution. Settlements are a clear violation of international law 
and today stand in the way of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.  
Let us be clear. The situation in the occupied Palestinian territory is untenable. We cannot - and must not - become inured to it.  
We cannot tolerate a situation where young Palestinian people have no confidence in 
political progress and no hope for the future. The risk – the very real risk-  is that the 
space for the political middle -ground is being squeezed out, lessening further the 
prospects of a just and lasting solution.  
The international community must renew its efforts. Progress will not be possibl e 
without addressing the root causes of the conflict. The Security Council must fulfil its responsibilities. Crucially, it must work for compliance with its own resolutions.  
On Afghanistan, since the Taliban takeover of Kabul, Ireland has resolutely defend ed the 
human rights of the Afghan people, particularly women and girls, and we have increased our humanitarian aid.  
We helped to ensure that the mandate for the UN mission in Afghanistan, adopted in March, was directly informed by the courageous activism of Afghan women. And we have pushed for accountability for the Taliban’s actions.  
But we continue to witness the ongoing erosion of the rights of Afghan citizens, particularly women and girls, but also those of ethnic and religious minorities and the LGBTQI+ community.  
September is a month when many students around the world return to school. For girls in Afghanistan, there is no return. They have now been out of school for more than ayear. This is a clear violation of their fundamental rights and freedoms.  Their potential 
will not be fulfilled and that of Afghanistan weakened if this situation continues to 
prevail.  
President, Excellencies  
At this time of heightened nuclear threat, it is deeply regrettable that one country alone, Russia, prevented agreement at the Tenth Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty last month.  
The heightened nuclear risks arising from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, and the threats to nuclear safety and security resulting from military activity in a nd near civilian 
nuclear facilities in Ukraine, are unprecedented.  
The Nuclear Non -Proliferation Treaty must remain an essential element of international 
peace and security. The urgency of its full implementation cannot be over stated.  
President, Excellenc ies 
In the past few days, many of my colleagues in this Hall have spoken of Russia’s illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. For European Member States in particular, this carries dark echoes of our continent’s past.  
We face an expansionist power, brutall y invading and occupying a peaceful neighbour.  
We faced this many times in Europe in the 20th century. We did not think we would face it again in the 21st century.  
But this is not just a European issue. Not just a concern for ‘the West’.  
All States, and particularly small countries such as my own, should fear a world where might equals right, where the strong can bully the weak; where sovereignty and territorial integrity can be blatantly violated; and where the UN Charter – the Charter 
that all of us in this Assembly have faithfully put our trust in –  can be flouted with 
impunity.  
In Ukraine in July, I heard first -hand accounts from civilians of the brutality and violence 
visited upon men, women and children by occupying Russian forces. And where Russia’s forces have been pushed back, we have seen the wanton destruction, and the uncovering of mass civilian graves, such as in Bucha and more recently in Izium.  
We have seen the targeting of nuclear facilities and of civilian infrastructure.  
And now we see Presi dent Putin plan sham referenda in eastern Ukraine, aimed at 
forcibly changing Ukraine’s borders, in clear violation of the UN Charter. We have to name what we are seeing. These actions, taken collectively, show Russia behaving as a rogue state.  
We are also  seeing how the impact of Russia’s aggression reaches far beyond Ukrainian 
or European shores and borders.From the Horn of Africa to the Sahel, and beyond, food insecurity has reached a critical 
tipping point.  
Some of the countries which have been worst a ffected by the current food insecurity 
crisis are those most reliant on imports of wheat from Russia and Ukraine.  
Combined with the impact of climate change, and of conflict, severe drought and other extreme weather events, we face a crisis that needs urgent action.  
Like many others represented in this Hall, Ireland has responded by increasing our humanitarian aid. This has included direct humanitarian support of €78 million for the Horn of Africa, and sustained and early funding to other severely affected countries and regions, including Yemen, Afghanistan and the Sahel.  
And yesterday, along with the US, UNICEF and others, Ireland led a pledging event, at which we committed an additional €50 million over 3 years specifically to tackle acute child malnutriti on. 
We have also increased our core funding to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, in recognition of the critical importance of enabling UN agencies to respond rapidly as crises unfold.  
We have prioritised gender -responsiveness in our humanitarian work , addressing the 
particular vulnerabilities faced by women, girls and boys in emergency settings.  
And we have adapted our funding and our programing so that we respond to humanitarian emergencies in a way that underpins our climate, development and 
peacebu ilding interventions; in a way that builds the resilience of individuals, families and 
communities.  
President, Excellencies  
The link between conflict and food insecurity is irrefutable. This is why we focused on Hunger and Conflict as a priority for our te rm on the Security Council. Conflict is now 
the main driver of hunger, reversing gains made over the last decades. We are failing in the challenge to reach zero hunger.  
Ireland’s longstanding commitment to food security will guide our international cooperation for many years to come. Ending world hunger and ensuring the right to food must be placed firmly at the top of the political agenda.  
At major Summits over the past twelve months -  on Food Systems, on Nutrition for 
Growth, and at the EU -AU Summit, Irel and has committed to helping partner countries 
on their journey towards sustainable, resilient and nutritious food systems.  
This transformation is more urgent now than ever before.  
And at COP27 later this year, we will be at the forefront of efforts to com bat the 
existential threat of climate change.Adaptation to climate change and its impacts will remain a key focus of our international 
engagement and support. We must make progress on averting, minimising and addressing losses and damages that are a direc t result of our changing climate.  
On global health, Ireland has strongly supported the work of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria since the Fund’s inception 20 years ago. This week, we announced a significant new contribution of €65 million over 3 years, a 30% increase on our previous such contribution, to support their important work against these diseases, and the related strengthening of health systems.  
President, Excellencies  
The United Nations, and the rules -based international order, is central to who we are as 
a nation.  
But multilateralism can only succeed if it is effective. And it can only be effective if we, the Member States, allow it to be so.  
That takes courage. It takes political will. It takes commitm ent to collective solutions to 
global challenges. It takes a readiness to compromise.  
It takes a genuine belief in the principles of the UN Charter.  
When, in a hundred years’ time, a future Irish leader marks the bicentenary of Ireland’s independence and r eturns to this hall, I hope they will be making a very different speech.  
One which celebrates substantive, sustained progress in ending conflict, tackling global inequality, poverty and hunger.  
One in which they will not cite frustrations over the use of t he veto at the Security 
Council to thwart the will of the majority of Member States, because the veto will be an anachronism that has long ceased to exist.  
One which refers to a strengthened and reformed UN system, structured and equipped to tackle the cha llenges of its day.  
One which remarks on the common will to uphold the principles of the UN Charter.  
One which looks back with relief at the collective action which brought this planet back from the brink of catastrophic collapse.  
Thank you.

 MLT_77_2022,"  Thank you, Mr President,   Secretary General,   Your Excellencies  Distinguished delegates,  The theme for this General Assembly is indeed an appropriate one.   For it truly is a watershed moment.   As I was preparing for my address of today, I thought to myself ""what is it that the people we represent want most?”   What do they expect of their leaders?   1. Peace 2. Equality  3. Prosperity  Every person wants to live in peace, be free and equal, and have a decent quality of life.   These are the three themes that I would like to focus my address on today.   All three are equally important, are interlinked, and go hand in hand.   This institution shall be focusing on delivering on them, through concrete actions, rather than words.   For far too long, world leaders have allowed disparties to grow in this world. Between the rich and the poor. Between those who have access to fundamental rights and needs such as healthcare, water, food, and technology – and those who are deprived of even the most basic of needs. Between those with different sexual orientations.   Peace, equality and prosperity are what we, as world leaders, should aspire to deliver to our people, to the world and to future generations. That is, if we truly want to make a positive difference in their lives.  Mr President   I want to start with discussing peace.   Peace builds. It restores. It strengthens.   Without peace, without security and without stability, we will never be able to focus on the more important challenges we face: to bring about growth, equality and prosperity.   This is what Malta, and its people stand for.   It is what our predecessors had in mind when they enshrined the following words in our constitution:   “Malta is a neutral state actively pursuing peace, security and social progress among all nations”  A declaration of principles that is echoed in the core values and principles of the UN Charter, which we should all be committed to uphold.    Today, peace is threatened by what Secretary General Guterres rightly referred to as the ""cauldron of crises"" we find ourselves in.   And unless we come together to work for global order and world peace, we stand no chance. For no single state can do it alone!   In 1989, Malta played an important role in bringing an end to the cold war by hosting the Bush - Gorbachev summit and remains more committed than ever to contribute to the re-establishment and maintenance of world peace, order and security.   As an island state in the Mediterranean, we have seen first-hand the effects of conflicts in our southern area. Over a decade of conflicts that led to instability! Wars and violence causing irreparable harm in Libya, Syria and Yemen, which also led to mass migration.   Equally tenuous are the situations in the Sahel, Afghanistan and the Middle East.   Naturally, at this moment the most prominent is the war in Ukraine.  Following decades of peace in mainland Europe, this is a stark reminder that peace can never be taken for granted.   Dear friends  Thousands of civilians have been killed and millions are suffering devastating losses. Close to 12.8 million people are estimated to have been displaced in Ukraine, which is a third of the nation’s population. The largest human displacement crisis in the world today.   The international community cannot afford to lose sight of any of these situations.   Sustained support from the international community is urgently required to address these humanitarian needs and put an end to the devastation. To end the suffering of innocent civilians.   Let us not underestimate the effects of this war.   Failure to act will also mean that instability will spill-over to neighbouring regions, with all its negative consequences – mass migration - human trafficking - and terrorism.   Yet, as the war rages on in Ukraine, we must not forget the other issues which require our attention and action.  Allow me to speak briefly about our brothers and sisters in Northern Africa, particularly those in Libya – a country that neighbours Malta. Under the auspices of the United Nations and without interference from foreign actors, I augur that this country and its people transition to more peaceful, secure, stable and prosperous times.  For that to happen, decisions must be taken to immediately put aside vested interests in Libya, once and for all.  This is what the Libyan people deserve and what's best not just for the region, but for the Mediterranean continent and the African continent in general.   Mr President   We are indeed living trying times as a result of these wars.   Times when despite our efforts, equality remains a remote concept.   Today’s global food supplies and energy markets have been shaken like never before, mostly because of the war in Ukraine.   The knock-on effects will be felt by our people in different ways.  Right now, these effects are taking the shape of constraints in the purchase of grains, fertilizers, agricultural equipment and livestock feed, the shortages of which have inflated the prices of key basic imports.   This has in turn impacted negatively the purchasing power of consumers around the world.   This continuous rise in the rate of inflation on food products, and food scarcity, is a major cause for concern and should be at the top of our agenda.   These pressures impact small islands, like my country, harder due to their insularity and other specificities. In Malta’s case, we took calculated strategic decisions to support and stand behind our people all the way in the best possible manner.  If we do not support our people until the situation betters, we will have failed them.   We cannot leave our people alone to carry the burdens.  At the same time, we need to keep aware that this prolonged situation will lead to increased pressures on the economic, social and environmental sustainability of us all.   It is also our duty, as citizens of a global, interconnected world to work towards more sustainable food systems. Fulfilling our commitment towards zero hunger. But in order to end hunger, we must also end conflict and war.  The right to food is a recognised human right, and the consequences of not acting to safeguard this, compounded with the devastation caused by climate change, could be severe and may lead to famine and further displacement of people.   Global poverty is estimated to have risen so far by over 70 million people. And with the probability of further marked increases in the coming months, this is something we cannot afford.  Our appeal is for the United Nations to address the global needs for resilience as a counterpart and counterbalance to the dynamics of globalization, as a matter of top and urgent priority.   In this regard, my country is a firm believer that international fair trade is a key element for the development of nations and is particularly important for smaller economies. Economies that are largely depend on external demand and supply for economic growth and increased social wellbeing.   The pandemic has made a severe dent in the historically declining poverty rate. Food insecurity, and price hikes, will exacerbate the plight of millions of people around the world, as the effects of war in Ukraine could continue pushing the number of people falling below the at-risk-of-poverty line even more.    Mr President   Solutions in the 21st century are not found through the use of force and weapons. We can only prevent further deterioration of this situation if we manage to resolve war through dialogue, and meaningful negotiating efforts.  The 21st century should not be an era of war.  The search for peace requires that all the players in this war put the best interests and priorities of all peoples first.   We all know what the best interests of the people are.   Our absolute priority should be to re-establish peace and order. To end war.  That is what our people are telling us. This is what they deserve. This is what we have to deliver to them, without further delays.  Three years, three full years of continued crises, including a pandemic. The most vulnerable in our societies are the ones that have been the hardest hit.   Social unrest will increase if our people’s quality of life deteriorates.   That is why we must intensify our pursuit for peace, equality and justice for all.   Malta continues to stand with the people of Ukraine, as they keep facing unprovoked aggression. We will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians and condemn tactics and recent statements that do not augur well, and will most probably mean further deterioration of the situation.   Mr President   Prosperity is the third theme I want to delve into.   Economic resilience is now more important than ever.   Only through economic ties and interdependence, through the freedom of movement of people and capital across countries, can we hope for long-lasting world peace.  For decades, globalization has been hailed as the next frontier of economic growth. By enabling human, financial and capital resources to find their best possible deployment.   By fostering jobs through international trade, creating wealth through technological advancement and dissemination, and allowing for better diversification against risk through the creation of multiple investment opportunities.  Our time is now! If not now, when? Let us turn the challenges we face into opportunities.  To transform our economies and make them future ready.  To focus on our green objectives. It is imperative that during these trying times, we avoid any temptation to put climate on the backburner.  Make no mistake, the future is green. The future is digital.  I’ll focus on the latter first.   The digital sphere is one which Malta has recognised and embraced. We have invested heavily in our digital economy both in the public administration, as well as in the business and social sphere.    Today, we rank first in the EU in terms of e-Government, and 5th on the EU Digital Economy and Society Index.   This is no coincidence. It is the result of our strategic vision on digitalisation.   Our priority is to keep our citizens always at the very heart of our policies, and strive to improve their quality of life, at multiple levels, from providing excellent quality services, increasing the number of high-quality jobs, and reducing the digital divide to avoid anyone falling behind on the use of technology.   Digital is the future, and we are committed to it.  In parallel to the digital transition, we have to work on the green one. And in both areas, we must continue advocating the need to close the digital gap across nations to ensure a level playing field.  The displacement of people due to climate change, particularly due to droughts and sea level rise leading to loss of territory, is taking place on our watch.   Though no one is safe from climate change, it is those who are the most vulnerable that are impacted the most. In Pakistan, floods have already claimed thousands of lives. And, what about the heatwaves and droughts in China, California, the Middle East, Africa and Asia? The cyclones and typhoons in Japan.  All these are climate disasters that happened in 2022, but may become the order of the day if we do not intensify our efforts.   There is no quick fix. Far from it !   Here I must reiterate: global challenges require global solutions.  Together, we must keep the 1.5-degree target alive; ensure that no one is left behind, and continue working towards building decarbonised nations and societies.  As my country is about to embark on its two-year term on the UN Security Council, we intend to do our utmost to continue to keep climate change on the international peace and security agenda.  Climate change poses a serious threat to us all, but particularly to Small Islands Developing States, and many coastal communities. It threatens state sovereignty, brings loss of territory, and causes damage to states’ critical infrastructure as well as their existing rights under maritime zone boundaries.   As the Prime Minister of Malta, I am fully aware of the threat that climate change is posing to small island states all over the world. No matter how near or far, we truly share similar climate challenges.   Malta was one of the founding members of the Alliance of Small Island Developing States and aims to become a leader in Small Island State Governance.   A lot has already been done in recent years. Malta has been channeling overseas development aid for decades and we are committed to continue offering support through scholarships, dedicated learning and training programmes in various areas.   One such area is water management.   Water scarcity will be one of the biggest impacts of climate change. Our practices in water management, particularly through the sourcing of water through desalination and recycling of wastewater, can serve as a model for addressing our world’s future needs - especially in view of the increasing recurrence of droughts brought about by climate change.  Moreover, small states may serve as platforms where innovative ideas and technologies can be tested and eventually identified as international best practices and adopted on a wider scale.    Malta launched the Island for Islands initiative at COP26 in Glasgow last year, and we intend to continue to build on this further.   Our aim is to bring to the fore the realities of small island economies as we strive to decarbonize and digitalize and fulfill the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.  Safeguarding our oceans remains one of our key priorities.  The interplay between climate change and the health of our ocean is important for Malta as we draw from our maritime legacy and our historical contribution at the United Nations.   The ocean plays a vital role in combating climate change, but it is also vulnerable to the impact of climate change, such as the changes in sea temperature, the rise in sea levels, and the effects on sea currents.  That is why as members of the UN Security Council, we will place particular emphasis on bridging the gap between science, policy and law making to address global security concerns, especially for the ocean, as the single largest habitat on our planet.  Mr President   Allow me to take this opportunity to thank you for placing your trust and confidence in my country to serve on the Security Council for a two-year term starting in January 2023.  As a member state of the European Union, located between two continents, we are committed to promote dialogue and understanding with a view to strengthened cooperation and social progress.   Whilst the challenges we face are many - together and if we concentrate our efforts, I am sure there are no obstacles which  we cannot overcome.  It is through cooperation and exchange that we can see our societies grow and thrive. Now is the time for nations to reach out and deepen ties with existing partners and develop new relations with others.   As a UN member, and as a member of the UN Security Council from next year, Malta stands ready to work with other Member States to maintain and foster international peace and dialogue.   To finding transformative solutions to today’s challenges by fostering peace, strengthening equality, and delivering prosperity.  Keeping security, sustainability, and social justice at the very heart of our efforts and priorities.   I would like to conclude by conveying a message my 10-year-old daughter Giorgia Mae, who is here in the audience, wished me to pass on when I explained to her that I would be addressing this meeting of world leaders.  She said: “I would like the world leaders to be an example to us children and leave behind a beautiful Earth”.   May this simple message enable us to deliver what is expected of us.  Thank you", MLT,2022

STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SPAIN  
 
H.E. MR. PEDRO SÁNCHEZ PÉREZ -CASTEJÓN  
 
AT THE GENERAL DEBATE  
OF THE SEVENTY -SEVEN SESSION OF THE  
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS  
 
 
New York, September 22, 2022  
 
(unofficial translation, check against delivery ) 
 Mr President, Mr  Secretary -General, Heads of State and Government, Ambassadors and  Delegates,  
Rarely have the foundations of this institution been shaken as strongly as in the early hours of 24 February, 
when cities throughout Ukraine felt the terror of Russian bombardments . 
More than six months later, we are still witness to the horror  of an invasion that take s us back to times we 
believed we had left behind . 
Yesterday, Putin continued his  headlong  rush with totally unacceptable statements.  
From this platform and what it represents, I want to condemn in the strongest terms the announcem ent of 
the annexation referendum s in the occupied territories of Done tsk, Luhansk and Kherson.  
These false referendums would constitute a new violation of international law by Putin.  
Let me be clear. The result s will never be recognized. We will continue to support the independence, 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.  
Precisely now is when we need to act united in defence of the principles enshrined in the UN Charter and 
in support of Ukraine is most needed.  
This war seeks to rob the sovereig n people of Ukraine from  their legitimate right to exist in peace and 
freedom and it has condemn ed the entire world to an era of uncertainty . And it has done so at the very 
moment when we were on the cusp of a well -deserved era of optimism , just after humanity had succe ssfully 
set in motion the greatest scientific and humanitarian cooperation  effort  of its history , to combat Covid-19. 
In these uncertain times , the economic and social consequences of the war are a threat to global prosperity. 
A food crisis is unfolding , together with an energy crisis provoked  by an autocrat who will stop at nothing to 
stay in  power. The impact on prices, already rising due to the supply chain  disruptions , threatens to leave 
the world’s poorest even poorer . 
It is not hard to understand  why many people feel that they have had enough . Especially young people , 
born at the start of this new millennium. A generation that, as well as  confronting this  new crisis in their 
lives, is living under the very real threat of the climate emergency and its consequences for the world they 
will inherit.  
But, despite everything, I am certain that precisely where the danger lies, there too lies our salvation. This 
is why, today, I wish to extend an unequivocal message of trust and confidence.  
Trust in the capacity of the international community to overcome any adversity. And confidence in the 
strength of an institution such as the United Nat ions to rise up against  challenges that know no borders. 
 Allow me to focus this reflection on five major challenges: the commitment to global health, the food crisis, 
the ecological transition, the digital transition , and gender equality.  
In matters of glo bal health, it is essential that we learn from the lessons of our fight against the pandemic. 
On 9 November 2020, the whole world celebrate d the news that the first vaccine against the virus was 
proving successful. Barely six weeks  later, the first doses began to be administered. With these vaccines,  
not only  did we  invert  the trend of the pandemic: we also reversed  the pessimism of a world that had come 
to question whether things would ever return to normal. The vaccine represents the triumph of the human  
spirit over adversity.  
In just two years, the world has managed to develop forty vaccines against C ovid-19. Through COVAX, 
more than two billion dose s have been allocated  to developing countries. Massive vaccination campaigns 
have enabled us to control the spread of the virus and return to normality in many countries. However, it is 
clear that much remains to be done. There is a n outrageous  degree of inequality between countries as 
regards access to the vaccine. This inequality, moreover, is to the detriment of humanity  as a whole : a virus 
cannot be eradicated if its spread is not halted  in every corner of the planet.  
Spain seeks to be part of the global solution to this enormous challenge. We will contribute €15 million to 
the Financial Intermediary Fund for Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response, and we support  
the adoption of a legally binding international instrument for this purp ose by the World Health Organi zation.  
Our indebtedness to science demands that we act in other areas that may have been neglected in the race 
against the virus. We must , for example,  step up our efforts and promote scientific research to guarantee 
universal access to medical care and treatment.  
Over the next three years, Spain intends  to allocate  more than 237 million euros of its Official Development 
Assistance to health -related issues, including 130 million euros for the Global Fund to Fight Aids,  
Tuberculosis and Malaria.  
The second major challenge I wish to  speak of is the food crisis currently threaten ing millions of human 
beings. This is a complex  problem that has the potential to deteriorate yet further in 2023.  
The crisis has been heightened by Russia’s blockade of grain exports  from Ukraine , but also by selfish 
decisions to erect barriers to trade in agricultural products and fertili zers. 
Two days ago, as cosponsor of the Leaders Network “Reinforcing Multilateralism Together”, I co -chaired 
together with the President of Senegal and Chairperson of the African Union, the President of the European 
Council and the US Secretary of State, the Food Security Summit . It gathered  world leaders from all regions, 
especially those most affected by th is crisis, and we adopted a joint declaration renewing our commitment 
to deal with the crisis . 
 This meeting had a very clear purpose: to address th is challenge and to seek solutions, as a matter of 
urgency. At this meeting, I announced that Spain would mobili ze 151 million euros in donations and a further 
85 million euros in loans , over the next three years.  
This action is consistent with Spain's commitment to combating inequality and poverty the world  over. A 
commitment that is exemplified in the new Cooperati on Act, which provides that Spain will allocate  0.7% of  
its Gross National Income  to Official Development Assistance by 2030.  
The third major  challenge I wish to discuss is the climate emergency , and the need to foster  an ecological 
transition, with urgency and determination.  
The current  energy crisis requires us to invest decisively in more sustainable energy mod els and to increase 
our energy in dependence . It is essential that we diversify , electrify , and decarboni ze our energy mix, for the 
following two reasons:  
Firstly, to prevent countries from using their energy resources as a weapon of war. The Putin regime 
believes it has the right to blackmail the entire planet, pushing up inflation and jeopardizing  the necessary  
recovery of our economies from the pandemic.  
And, secondly, to respond to the fundamental and increasingly evident challenge fac ed by  our own 
generation and by those yet to come: the challenge of climate change. In the light of current events, we must 
be even more determined than ever to fulfil  the commitments made to decarboni ze our economies.  
The question is  not whether it is convenient to do so . It is how to do so fairly and with the speed demanded  
by scien ce: time is running out . 
In this respect, Spain wishes to  put forward specific solutions to the United Nations. Together with Senegal, 
we will support the creation of an “International Alliance for Drought Resilience” to promote innovation, 
technology transfer  and the mobili zation of resources to combat  drought in countries exposed to this threat.  
Later this year , in November, we will present this initiative at the COP 27 in Egypt, in conjunction with the 
Secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat D esertification and with other interested countries.  
The energy crisis is placing a strain on every country in Europe , including my own , and is hitting the middle 
and working classes  especially hard . All the measures being adopted to reduce its impact are based on a 
common principle: that this time, the costs and sacrifices will not be borne by th at vast majority of citizens 
which has already suffered too much in previous crises.  
Spain has promoted far -reaching regulatory reforms to reduce the impact of  rising gas prices. But we are 
well aware of the need to overhaul the electricity sector, throughout the European Union , and this is 
 something we have been working on for more than a year . It is time to bring the sector closer into line with 
today’s reality, by limiting and distributing the costs and benefits of price increases  more fairly . 
The fourth great global challenge I would like to address concerns the digital transformation and its impact 
on the future  of education and empl oyment.  
Just this  Monday, Spain  participate d in a session of the Transforming Education Summit  that was  dedicated 
to the digital transformation  of education . At this session, we evoked the lessons of the pandemic, stressing 
that technological solutions had made it possible to overcome  the barriers that were making in -person 
teaching impossible . 
Spain aspires to play ing a leading role  in this sphere . For example, the UN Technology Centre for the 
digitalization  of education, GIGA, will be established in Ba rcelona thanks to Spain’s collaboration with 
UNICEF and the International Telecommunication Union.  
Education is the key to making our societies  more informed and aware, and hence freer, more inclusive 
and more equal . If we wish to achieve further advances  in human rights, it is essential that we continue to 
support the right to education for all, but especially for girls.  
It is there, at school, where the path towards gender equality and the empowerment of women really starts.  
Which brings me to the fifth and final topic I wish to address today, namely the feminist agenda and the 
struggle for gender equality.  
We are living in  times in which demanding basic rights is still a revolutionary act. The global threats to 
women's sexual and reproductive freedom are  yet another example of how painfully slowly the world is 
moving towards guaranteeing full equality. Worse still is the fragility of our past social gains , which have 
fallen victim to  backsliding in certain advanced democracies —something quite inexplicable at this stage of 
the twenty -first century.  
Spain will continue to be at the forefront of this endeavour. The new Organic Law for the Comprehensive 
Guarantee of Sexual Freedom and the future Act on Sexual and Reproductive Health will help ensur e that 
the public health service continue s to attend to women and meet all their health needs, throughout our 
country.  
In this respect , I would like to announce that Spain will contribute 100 million euros over  the next three 
years to organi zations  such as UN Women that are working for gender equality, especially in the area of 
reproductive and sexual rights . 
It is essential that we listen to women, that we  eradicate the barriers preventing them from taking their 
rightful  place in companies, in gove rnments and in working for peace. 
 I invite you to compare images from 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Compare the family photos you keep at home 
with the images that appeared in the media at the time. In both  cases, you may be surprised, and even 
amused, to see how we have changed: in fashions, appearance  and custom s. 
But in comparing  such images, you will notice an inexcusable discrepancy : the presence of women in your 
family photographs and their absence from public images  reflect ing the political and economic realities of 
the time s. We have made great progress in equality between women and men. But much remains to be 
done  and nothing is guaranteed,  as we saw just a few months ago in Afghanistan when the Taliban returned 
to power . 
 
Ladies and  gentlemen,  
 
Last month I had the privilege of visiting the Centre for Memory, Peace and Reconciliation in Bogotá. I was 
able to witness , first-hand , the effort s made by an entire people , and especially its women, to move on from 
the past, to pay reparations to the victims, and to build a society free from violence. Colombia is embarking 
upon a new era of hope and of peace building, and Spain will be at its  side, ready to lend our support.  
The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have a fundamental role to play in the world, beginning 
with the defence of democracy. However, the region also needs international support , including in the fight 
against dr ug trafficking .  
Spain is more committed than ever  to Latin America and the Caribbean , and we will work to tighten EU 
relations with this region during our presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 
the coming year.  
Our presidency comes  at a key moment  for Europe. We will assume it with  hope and with trust , aware of 
the magnitude of the challenge and of the responsi bility it represents.  
We want Europe to broaden its vision, not only by revitalizing its fundamental alliance with Latin  America 
and the Caribbean,  but also by paying closer attention to its Southern Neighbourhood.  
Our intention is for the priorities I have just mentioned to inform and  guide our actions during those six months.  
The green transition, the d igital transition, but also the social one, will set the path that Spain will take during 
its Presidency.  
The European Union is a project of stability and harmony. A project of peace, which we would wish to see 
reflected in other areas of the planet, beginning with Ukraine. 
 It is clear that we must continue working to ensure that other countries and regions , in addition to Ukraine, 
also recover their stability. We are making headway in the negotiations to reach a nuclear agre ement with 
Iran, in which the European Union is playing an essential role. But we have seen , very recently , how the 
tensions in the East China Sea are threatening the status quo in a region that is key for both the present 
and the future of humanity . 
Asia’s  importance  to global security was made very clear at the NATO Summit held in Madrid earlier this 
year, with the Alliance’s Pacific partners participat ing, for the first time  ever, at the highest level .  
The Madrid Summit welcomed the two new NATO members, Sweden and Finland, and approved the 
Alliance’s new Strategic Concept, which will guide its future in the coming years.  
The Strategic Concept adopted in Madrid offers a  refined diagnosis  of an increasingly complex strategic  
environment . It feature s a significant  mention of the Alliance’s South ern flank  and, in particular , the Sahel, 
a region afflicted by growing instability. We must pay attention to the risks that are highly present in the 
region, such as irregular flows of migrants and the threat of terrorism. Said t hreats may soon  be exacerbated 
by the cumulative effects of the food and energy cris es, climate change , and demographic trends.  
We must leave behind the conflicts of the past century. That is why, as regards Western Sahara, Spain 
supports a mutually acceptable political solution  in the framework of the UN Charter and Security Council 
resolutions. In this regard, Spain fully supports the work of the UN Secretary -General’s  Special Envoy , 
which we deem to be absolutely crucial . 
Spain will also continue to support the Sahrawi population in the refugee camps , as it has always done, as 
the principal  international  donor of humanitarian assistance in this context . 
As regards Gibraltar , as I reported during last year’s Session, on 31 December 2020, Spain and the United 
Kingdom reached a bilateral understanding in the context of the United Kingdom’s departure from the 
European Union.  
We have been working since that date to ensure that said understanding serves to lay the foundations for  
the future relationship of this territory with the European Union, trusting that an Agreement may be reached 
as soon as possible between the European Union and the United Kingdom in relation to Gibraltar.  
This Agreement must fully respect UN doctrine rega rding said territory, with which Spain is fully aligned. 
And it must, too, respect  the legal position of my country as concerns the sovereignty and jurisdiction thereof . 
We wish to work to develop an area of social and economic prosperity encompassing  Gibraltar and the 
Campo de Gibraltar  in their entirety . 
  
Ladies and  gentlemen,  
 
At the beginning of this address  I spoke of two feelings: trust in the future and confidence  in this institution.  
Two years ago , we feared we might never again live in a world in which two people could shake hands or 
embrace each other . We came to the point of believ ing that such gestures of courtesy and affection would 
be collateral victims of the pandemic. Today, that world , which seemed out of reach, is already back . Similar 
fears have been felt at various moments of human history,  when society has been faced with seemingly 
insurmountable challenges . 
And yet hope, as ever, will lead the way . Sometimes with a push from science and knowledge. And other 
times simply due t o our will not to repeat the fatal  errors  of the past.  
Humanity will always find a way of overcoming the blows  it is dealt , and continue moving forward. What 
matters is how we deal with these blows ; how we heal the wounds inflicted upon us along the way, while at 
the same time protecting the most vulnerable . 
We must be guided by the values and principles endorsed by all of us as members of this Organization , in 
which Spain , yet again, wishes to express its utmost trust. We must persevere in our efforts and ambition 
to build a world that is freer, more prosperous , and more just. And to this end , it is essential that we  
strengthen rules -based multilateralism and, in short, that we  strive to  guarantee peace —the most valuable 
asset  we can possess . 
Thank you very much.", ESP,2022

BY 
THE MOST HONOURABLE ANDREW HOLNESS, ON, PC, MP  
 
GENERAL DEBATE  
77TH SESSION OF THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
“A watershed moment: transformative solutions to 
interlocking challenges”  
 
 
 
New York  
22 September 2 022  
 
 
 
Please check against delivery- 1 - 
 Mr President,  
 
I congratulate you on your election to the leadership of this distinguished  body. 
You can be assured of our full commitment to the successful execution of your 
mandate,  including from our position as a Vice -President of the session.  I also 
acknowledge your predecessor for his sterling stewardship of the General 
Assembly during his ‘Presidency of Hope’.  
 
This year, Jamaica celebrate s 60 years  of independence  and member ship in the 
UN.  We reflect with pride on the significant cont ributions which Jamaica, a small 
island developing state, has made to global efforts for peace, development and 
human rights , as well as in the fields of music, culture and sports .  
 
At home, our Diamond Jubliee of Independence has provided the impetus for  us 
to, ‘Re-ignite our nation for greatness ’.   It is our intention to bring that same energy  
to the work of the 77th Session.  
 
We gather as the world faces unprecedented  overlapping crises  - the ongoing 
impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine , inflatio n, debt, energy 
and food insecurity,  and natural disasters fuelled by climate change . While every 
country has been  negatively impacted , we do not all have the same capacity to 
withstand shocks and recover . Indeed , recovery has been uneven, and there has 
been further widening of pre-existing development inequalities.  
 
Sustainable Development /Global Economic System  
 
Mr. President,  
As we search for solutions, let us acknowledge the differentiated  needs and 
vulnerability of all members of our global family.  
 
Small Island De veloping States and some middle -income  countries have 
particular vulnerability to climate shocks and external economic shocks, which 
have an oversized  impact relative to their national budgets, and often crippling 
impact on their infrastructure. For SIDS to survive economic shocks  and recover 
lost and damage d infrastructure, they  are forced to borrow , only to be 
confronted again in a few years with another  round of  natural disaster s, which 
could wipe  out significant infrastructure and force  us to add to our already high- 2 - 
 debt. As I speak , I am monitoring  a tropical system that is threatening in the 
Caribbean.  
 
Jamaica believes that a comprehensive and targeted  approach to accessing 
development finance is needed. We fully support the work of the High -Level Panel 
develop ing the Multi -Dimensional Vulnerability Index .  We eagerly anticipate  an 
era of truly equitable  access to concessional financing and other funding support  
which will enable us to invest  in the resilient infrastructure  and create fiscal buffers 
so that we can withstand and recover quickly from the next  economic, health or 
climate  shock  with little borrowing.  
 
Without  the acknowledgment of vulnerability as a basis for access to finance, SIDS 
will continue to struggle  and will be unable to achieve the SDGs .  
 
Even as we call for reforms of the global financial architecture to account for 
vulnerability , Jamaica  is exercising  great fiscal discipline .  It has been a long and 
hard struggle,  but we have lowered  our debt -to-GDP ratio from stratospheric 
levels  a decade ago  and we continue to pursue policies to drive our debt 
downward. We are building fiscal buffers  to ensure we can respond quickly to 
shocks . We are working with development partners using innovative financing 
tools, such as floating a Catastrophe Bond  to insure us against climate disaster s. 
Most  important ly, we are mainstreaming climate resilience in all our infrastructure  
investment . 
 
Climate/Environment/Oceans / Blue Economy  
 
Mr. President,  
Small Island Developing States, like Jamaica are always mindful that despite  our 
best efforts to improve our fiscal management and debt sustainability, a single 
climate generated event could wipe out 100% of our economy in a few hours.  
 
Climate Change is an immediate existential threat for SIDS, like Jamaica , the 
Caribbean and the Pacific .  Concerted action to slow down and halt global 
temperature rise , is literally a question of our survival. While we will continue to 
develop our own resilience  and play our part in mitigating Climate Change , we 
canno t, by our action alone change the trajectory . Jamaica looks forward to the 
convening of COP27 in Egypt later this year.  We call on all countries to meet their 
commitments  and contributions to climate targets . And we call on the developed- 3 - 
 world  to increase their commitments and ambitions in climate financing , 
particularly for  adaptation and for loss and damage.   
 
Mr. President,  
As an island , Jamaica is keenly attuned to the importance of protecting and 
sustainably using our ocean and marine resources.  We recognise that urgent 
action is required to address the health and sustainability of the Ocean .  
 
Jamaica join s the global community in celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the UN 
Convention on the Law of the Sea , which opened for adoption in Montego Bay, 
Jamaica on 10 December in 1982 .  The Convention is a testament to the power 
of multilateralism.   
 
As the constitution for the ocean, the Convention has yielded immense benefit 
since its entry into force .  Since 1994, Jamaica has welcomed delegates to the 
International Seabed Authority, who have brought to life the important 
deliberations on the preservation and exploitation of resources of the 
international seabed, which forms part of the common heritage of mankind.  
 
Building on this, we continue to work towards a BBNJ agreement which is pivotal 
to safeguarding this shared resource for future generations and to ensuring equity 
in access to the benefits of the resources in the area.   
 
Digital Economy / Cybersecurity  / Cybercrime  
 
Mr. President,  
The pandemic  has made clear  that major inclusive transformation is required in 
Technology and Innovation.   While all countries suffered during the pandemic, 
they didn’t all suffer equally . A country’s economic resilience was often a 
reflection of how digitally advanced it was.  M any countries lag far behind in 
digital access, penetration , and capability. We must prioritize b ridging the digital 
divide , both within and between countries , to create a level playing field and to 
spur transformation of critical sectors of the economy and the society.  
 
As the world prep ares for an even more digitally engaged  future , we must take 
effective steps to protect cyberspace  and its physical infrastructure to ensure that 
it is safely and securely available to all users across the world.  Cybercrime s are an- 4 - 
 increasing threat and international cooperation is required to deal with this in a 
comprehensive manner.  
 
Jamaica fully support s the work underway in the UN to elaborate a cybercrime 
treaty and to work towards guidelines and a framework for cybersecurity.  
 
Crime and Weapons  
 
Mr. President ,  
Several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are facing an epidemic of 
crime and violence. Since the Pandemic and the disruption in education , 
challenges with mental health are increasingly being expressed in violent ways.  
 
The prop ensity to resolve conflict or cope with social and mental stresses through 
violence requires a public health response, and Jamaica has not only engaged 
in global initiatives such as the Partnership to End Violence Against Children, but 
has also empanelled a National Commission on the Prevention of Violence to 
advise  the government on building out an articulated public health and social 
services response.  
 
However, the situation is exponentially  complicated and exacerbated by the 
influx of illegal and unregistered small arms into our country. From organized 
transnational criminal enterprises  to street level gangs , to the misguided youth  in 
the inner  city, the availability of guns  is driving  an ever -increasing  homicide rate.  
In the same way that a war on drugs is being prosecuted, in which we have been 
faithful partners in policing what comes  through our waters or leaves our shores, 
there now needs to  be a “war on guns ”. Jamaica does not manufacture guns , 
but our population suffers from the effects of widely available guns . The countries 
that manufacture weapons that are available to the public  must implement 
stronger measures to ensure that those weapons do not end up on streets and in 
the hands of people for whom they were not intended.  
 
In the same way there is concern about illegal drugs on the street s of the rich 
countries there must be concern about guns on the street s of developing 
countries like Jamaica.- 5 - 
 Haiti  
Mr. President,  
The situation in our sister CARICOM country of Haiti is one of deep concern for 
Jamaica and the region. The challenges there - political, economic, 
environmental and social - are longstanding and present serious obstacles to  
peace and dignity of the Haitian people , and for the region, particularly. C rime 
and other security concerns  have a wider impact . We support a Haitian -led 
process to arrive at sustainable solutions  to the c hallenges,  and are committed, 
together with CARICOM and the international community , to moving beyond  
stand ing with Haiti , to working more closely with Haiti to  provide consistent and 
meaningful support . 
 
Cuba  
Mr. President,  
Jamaica also joins the calls, once again, for the discontinuation of the economic, 
commercial and financial embargo against our closest Caribbean neighbour, 
Cuba.  
 
Reparatory Justice  
Mr. President,  
We cannot properly make use of this watershed moment to benefit the future 
without adequately addressing the past.  Jamaica reaffirms its determination to 
further the call for the international recognition of reparatory justice as a 
necessary path to heali ng, restoration of dignity , and progress for people of 
African descent.   
 
The world cannot turn a blind eye to the systemic imbalances which persist  after 
centuries of exploitation . If our moral standards  today  on which we claim  a higher 
civilization , acknowledge s that actions in the past , which  generated wealth for 
some by depriving others of their freedom , was wrong ; then that same moral 
standard must lead those who benefited from the wrongs of the past and claim 
a higher civilization  today, to repair  that which their morality now acknowledges 
to be an injustice. There is an inescapable duty for economic  redress of historical 
injustices and recognition of the dignity of affected States and Peoples.   
 
The arc of international morality would not have completed its bend for the 
peoples of the African Diaspora,  without open and inclusive exchanges on the- 6 - 
 dispensation of reparatory justice. We recognise the complexities associated with 
this sensitive issue.  
 
Yet, as with all complex global challenges, we must summon the determination 
to take the bold and creative  steps to meet the moment.  
 
Multilateralism/The UN  
 
Mr. President,  
Since attaining independence  sixty years ago, multilateralism  has been a core 
principle of Jamaica’s foreign policy .  It continues to underpin  our cooperat ion 
with Member States and other stakeholders within the United Nations  system .  
Transformative global solutions will only thrive within a robust  multilateral  
framework .   
 
The current global political and security environment is cause for great alarm.  We 
have witnessed a  nuclear armed super -power, permanent member of the 
Security Council, acting with impunity  to launch a military offensive against its 
neighbour .  
 
Russia’s military incursion into Ukraine can only be condemned as a flagrant 
violation  of the UN Charter.  We must never return to the days when military might 
is considered a right.   
 
Jamaica strongly cautions against  actions which could signal the demise of a 
peaceful multilateral order .  
 
Mr. President,  
I commend the Secretary -General and his team on the initiatives undertaken 
within his purview to fulfil relevant mandates.   For their part, Membe r States must 
also ad dress long -outstanding issues of reform and restructuring, including of the 
Security Council. This critical organ must work more transparently and 
responsively , be more representative of the world of today, and more prepared 
for the world of tomorrow.  
 
A rotating seat for SIDS will ensure that the unique perspectives, challenges , and 
contribution of SIDS are permanently available to the Council , improving the 
quality of its work  in the service of our people.- 7 - 
  
Global Tourism Resilience Day  
Mr. President,  
As a highly tourism -dependent country, in the most tourism -dependent region in 
the world, Jamaica has  invested heavily in building resilience in the tourism sector . 
During the pandemic,  we pioneered the introduction of “resilient corridors” on the 
island , which served as a focused, protocol -based and data -driven blueprint for 
safely reopening the tourism sector.  The corridors assisted greatly in fast -tracking 
the recovery for our touris m sector.  
 
We have been engaging countries across the world i n our efforts to bolster 
resilience in  Global Tourism  and Jamaica is proposing the official designation of 
February 17th annually as Global Tourism Resilience Day .  
 
This annual commemoration would serve to encourage a consistent examination 
of resilience -building in the tourism sector, in the face of persisting global 
disruptions to sustainable tourism and sustainable development. We encourage 
the global community to work with us towards commemorating the first Global 
Tourism Resilience Day in 2023.  
 
Closing  
 
Mr President,  
While our current reality presents complex challenges, I believe that the capacity 
and capabilities exist within in this body to overcome the challenges. The gap 
between challenges we face and solutions which exist, or yet to be created, is 
the human will.  This assembly is about developing the common global political 
will to see this as a watershed moment to deploy and accelerate transformative 
solutions to the interlocking challenges we face. The people of the world are 
counting on us to lead and work toge ther as one humanity, one love. Jamaica is 
committed to doing our part, in this our sixtieth year of membership, and in the 
years ahead.  
 
I thank you.", JAM,2022

Minister  of Foreign  Affairs  of the Kingdom  of Bahrain  
77th Session  of United  Nations  General  Assembly  
September  2022  
 
 
United  Nations  Headquarters,  New  York  
 
 
Your  Excellency,  Mr. Csaba  Kőrösi   
President  of the 77th session  of the United  Nations  General  Assembly,  
Your  Majesties , Highnesses  and Excellencies,  
Heads  of delegations,  
 
Greetings,   
 
It is with pleasure , Mr. President,  that I congratulat e you and your country  on your election  
as the President  of the General  Assembly  in its current  session,  and I wish you success  
in managing  its work . I would  also like to express  thanks  and appreciation  to the former  
President  of the UNGA,  H.E. Mr. Abdullah  Shahid,  for his efforts  in leading  the previous  
session  competently  and professionally .  
 
May I also express  the Kingdom  of Bahrain’s  appreciation  and support  to His Excellency  
Antonio  Guterres,  the Secretary -General  of the United  Nations  for his distinguished  efforts  
in reinforcing  the internatio nal role of the organisation , and its contributions  to preserv ing 
international  peace  and security,  the protect ion of human  rights,  coordinat ion of 
human itarian  relief  operations,  and support  for the Sustainable  Development  Goals, 
climate  action  and environmental  protection . 
 
Mr. President,  
 
The general  debate  of the current  session  is taking  place  amid st armed  conflicts  in most  
parts  of the world,  and shared  economic  challenges , of great  importance  and danger,  
which,  if left unresolved,  along  with the increase d threat  of terrorist  organizations  in 
various  parts  of the world  that have  not been  comprehensiv ely addressed,  would  lead to 
wider  conflict  with greater  destruction,  killing,  misery,  human  deprivation,  displacement  of 
innocents,  whilst  threatening  the lives of those living  in peace,  especially  women  and 
children,  prevent ing individuals  and societies  from realising their most  basic  rights  to a 
dignified  and stable  life. 
  
These  threats  impose  the inevitability  of international  partnership  and joint coordination,  
at the bilateral  and multilateral  levels,  to end wars  and conflic ts and to resolve  them  
through  dialogue  and peaceful  means,  as well as constructive  cooperation  between  great  
powers  to achieve  international  peace  and security,  combat  extremism  and terrorism  from 
its financial,  organizational  and ideological  foundations,  and address  any political,  
economic  or social  problems  that may fuel conflicts,  disputes  or hatred.  
 
My country  believes  that the only way to resolve  the existing  regional  and international  
crises  is through  adher ence  to the principles  of the United  Natio ns, including  most  
importantly:  respect  for sovereignty  and international  law, non-interference  in the internal  
affairs  of countries,  achieving  consensus  on more  effective  mechanisms  in order  to avoid  
future  conflicts,  and resolving  disputes  before  they break  out, ending  the heavy  loss of 
lives and properties , with the channelling  of financial  resources  to lift millions  of people  
out of hunger,  poverty  and illness , instead  of wasting  wealth  on igniting  hostility  and 
hatred.  
 
In order  for us to avoid  or prevent  future  conflicts,  we must  do everything  in our power  to 
resolve  disputes  or disagreements  before  they turn violent . To do so, we must  believe  in 
the key role of promoting  the values  of tolerance,  coexistence,  mutual  respect  and 
dialogue  in preventing  the outbreak  of conflict  and preserving  security,  whilst  building  
cooperation  and confidence  between  countries . 
 
The United  Nations  remains  a key element  in supporting  dialogue  and peaceful  
coexistence  among  cultures  and civilizations,  reinforcing  human  solidarity  in addressing  
the problems  of poverty  and hunger,  allocating  more  resources  to assist  the least  
developed  countries  and the most  disadvantaged  groups, and encouraging  scientific  
research  and exchanging  experiences  in preserving  the environment  and treating  
diseases  and pandemics . 
 
Mr. President,  
 
The security  and stability  of the Middle  East region  is a fundamental  pillar  of international  
peace  and security , with this vital and strategic  region  facing  wars  and crises  that have 
caused  enormous  human  and economic  losses,  displaced  millions,  threatened  
navigation,  trade,  energy,  water  and food security,  and deprived  millions  of the young  
people  of the region  of hope  and optimism  for a better  and more  prosperous  future . 
 
Under  the leadership  of His Majesty  King Hamad  bin Isa Al Khalifa,  the Kingdom  of 
Bahrain , in all its diplomatic  positions  and effective  international  responses,   has always 
 stressed  the need  for international  cooperation  and partnership  on the basis  of brotherly  
relations,  understanding,  and principles  of good  neighbourliness , respect  for the 
sovereignty  of countries  and non-interfer ence  in their internal  affairs,  giving  priority  to 
dialogue  and diplomatic  solutions  in settling  regional  and international  conflicts  and 
tensions,  as well as consolidating  peaceful  coexistence  among  all religions,  civilizations  
and cultures,  based  on the Char ter of the United  Nations  and the principles  of international  
law. 
 
The Kingdom  of Bahrain  has prioritized  strengthening  integration  and interdependence  
between  the countries  of the Cooperation  Council  for the Arab  States  of the Gulf and their 
people  and building  on the achievements  made  in following  up the outcomes  of the Al-
Ula Summit,  whilst  fulfilling  the requirements  for economic  unity  and joint development  
programs , as well as defence  and security  systems,  in a way that enhances  the security  
and unity  of the GCC  countries  and its effective  regional  and international  role.  
 
The Kingdom  of Bahrain  is also keen  to preserve  the security,  stability,  unity  and territorial  
integrity  of Arab  countries,  which  is an integral  part of our national  security,  and we have  
confidence  in the ability  of brotherly  countries  to resolve  their crises and overcome  any 
differences  through  political  dialogue.  
 
The Kingdom  believes  that achieving  a just and comprehensive  peace  in the Middle  East 
region  depends  primarily  on settling  the Palestinian -Israeli  conflict  in accordance  with the 
two-state  solution, resolutions  of international  legitimacy,  and the Arab  Peace  Initiative.  
 
Based  on these  established  principles  and values,  the Kingdom  of Bahrain  has taken  
serious  initiatives  by hosting  the “Peace  to Prosperity”  workshop,  signing  the Abraham  
Accords  and the Declaration  Supporting  Peace,  which  has entered  its third year,  
embodying  the importance  of cooperation  instead  of confrontation  and conflict,  and 
work ing to build  trust and partnership s in order  to meet  the aspirations  of people  for 
securit y, peaceful  coexistence,  prosperity  and sustainable  development.  
 
In this regard,  the Kingdom  of Bahrain  welcomes  the existing  truce  in Yemen , with the 
support  and sponsorship  of the United  Nations,  in line with the initiative  of the Kingdom  
of Saudi  Arabia  and its efforts  to reach  a comprehensive  and sustainable  political  solution  
to the Yemeni  crisis, in accordance  with the Gulf Initiative  and its executive  mechanism,  
the outcomes  of the comprehensive  national  dialogue,  and Security  Council  Resolution  
No. 2216 , reaffirming  the importance  of opening  all humanitarian  corridors , and 
enhancing  economic  and development  support  for the Yemeni  people. 
 We also affirm  our support  for the legitimate  historical  rights  of the Arab  Republic  of Egypt  
and the Republic  of Sudan  to the waters  of the Nile river,  and for the protection  of their 
water  security,  whilst  supporting  their endeavours  to reach  a bindin g legal  agreement  on 
filling  and operating  the Grand  Ethiopian  Renaissance  Dam  in a way that benefits  all 
parties,  in accordance  with the rules  of international  law. 
 
We renew  our firm stance  and solidarity  with the Kingdom  of Morocco  in preserving  its 
security and territorial  integrity,  and we value  the Security  Council  Resolution  No. 2602  
of 2021  on the Moroccan  Sahara.  
 
The Kingdom  of Bahrain  affirms  its interest  in establishing  friendly  and balanced  relations  
with all countries  in the Middle  East region , including  the Islamic  Republic  of Iran, in 
compliance  with the United  Nations  Charter  and international  law, the principles  of good  
neighbourliness , and non-interference  in the affairs  of other  countries,  with respect  to 
international  law and the sovereignty  of states  and their religious  and cultural  values,  and 
refrain ing from the use or threat  of force,  calling  upon  Iran to fully cooperate  with the 
International  Atomic  Energy  Agency,  and to work  to make  the Middle  East region,  
including  the Arab ian Gulf,  a zone  free of weapons  of mass  destruction.  
 
Mr President,  
 
The Kingdom  of Bahrain,  under  the wise leadership  of His Majesty  King Hamad  bin Isa 
Al Khalifa,  with the direction  of the Government  under  His Royal  Highness  Prince  Salman  
bin Hamad  Al Khalifa,  the Crown  Prince  and Prime  Minister,  has been  able to turn 
challenges  into opportunities  and success  stories  thanks  to the team  work  characterised  
by its responsibility  and united  spirit , placing  at the forefront  of its priorities  respect  for 
human  rights,  dignity,  freedoms,  welfare  and security , which  is the real wealth  of the 
country  and the focus  of the comprehensive  development  process  and its purpose . 
 
“Team  Bahrain”  presented  a pioneering  and civilized model  in overcoming  the 
repercussions  of the COVID -19 pandemic,  as the Kingdom  provided  free health  services  
and examinations  for all citizens  and residents  without  discrimination , grant ing nearly  3.5 
million  doses  of vaccines , representing  more  than 230% of the total population,  67% of 
whom  have  received  the booster  dose.  This is in addition  to the launch  of a financial  and 
economic  package  since  March  2020  worth  12 billion  US dollars,  equivalent  to a third of 
gross  domestic  product,  to support  the most affected  individuals  and sectors,  and to 
reduce  the economic  and social  repercussions , leading  to the Kingdom  deservedly  being  
placed  first in the world  in the recovery  rate according  to international  indicators,  with 
Manama  becoming  the first “Healthy  City” in the Middle  East region  according  to the World  
Health  Organization  (WHO) . 
  
In order  to further  enhance  its development  process,  the Kingdom  of Bahrain  has 
continued  to implement  an integrated  plan for economic  recovery  that included  the 
completion  of an advanced  national  program  for employment  and training  of citizens,  
updating  legislation  and commercial  procedures  to attract  foreign  direct  investment,  
launching  major  strategic  development  projects,  moderni sing infrastructure,  establishin g 
new investment  and industrial  zones,  and developing  oil and non-oil economic  sectors  
along  with the shift to the fourth  industrial  revolution,  with support  for the digital  economy  
and artificial  intelligence  technologies,  tourism,  logistics  and financial  sectors,  as well as 
promoting  program mes for financial  sustainability,  economic  stability  and fiscal  balance . 
 
The Kingdom  of Bahrain  is also keen  to follow  up on its commitments  to achieve  the 
Sustainable  Development  Goals,  and looks  forward  to presentin g its second  voluntary  
report  on the implementation  of the SDGs  next year.  
 
Out of its awareness  of the interdependence  between  the environment,  natural  resources  
and human,  food and water  security,  the Kingdom  of Bahrain  has affirmed  its support  for 
the four major  international  initiatives  in the field of climate  change , and its commitment  
to achieving  net zero by 2060,  reducing  emissions  by 30% by 2035,  doubling  green  
spaces,  and enhancing  the effective  use of energy  and renewable  energy  sources.  
 
 
My country stresses  the importance  of strengthening  international  cooperation  in 
protecting  the environment  and addressing  climate  change  in a sustainable  and equitable  
manner,  while  ensuring  energy  security , expressing  its support  for the “Green  Saudi  
Arabia”  and “Green  Middle  East”  initiatives,  and wishes  the brotherly  Arab  Republic  of 
Egypt  success  in hosting  and chairing  the Conference  of the Parties  to the UN Framework  
Convention  on Climate  Change  (COP27 ) next November  in Sharm  El-Sheik h. 
 
My country  will soon  witness  a new blossoming  chapter  in its democratic  path, with the 
sixth round  of parliamentary  and municipal  elections  this November,  so that the 
parliament  continue s to enact  its legislative  and oversight  powers , whilst  expressing  the 
true will of the electorate  within  the framework  of the coordination  between  the Shura  and 
Representative  Councils,  where  the fully elected  Council  of Representatives  provides  all 
Bahrainis  with the opportunity  to participate , while  the Shur a Council  will ensure  the 
inclusion  of different  groups , including  minorities  from all parts  of society .  
 
The Kingdom  of Bahrain  is proud  of having  modern  legislation  compatible  with its 
accession  to seven  of the nine major  human  rights  instruments,  which  match  the highest  
international  human  rights  standards,  the most  prominent  of which  is the “Alternative 
 Sanctions  and Measures  Law” , which  has benefited  more  than 4,200  convicts  since  its 
implementation  in May 2018 , as well as its current  approach  towards  open  prisons  in line 
with modern  criminal  justice  systems,  and the adoption  of the law on restorative  justice  
for children  and the protection  of children  from ill-treatment,  in addition  to other  legislation  
that supports  human  rights  in a society  based  on freedom,  equality,  justice,  security,  and 
social  solidarity.  
 
In order  to enhance  its human  rights  and development al gains,  my government  has this 
year approved  the National  Human  Rights  Plan (2022 -2026),  which  includes  102 projects,  
prepared  in cooperation  with the Office  of the United  Nations  Resident  Coordinator,  and 
in consultation  with representatives  of the legislative,  executive  and judicial  authorities,  
national  human  rights  institutions  and UN organizations , which  is currently  being  
imple mented  through  an approach  of dialogue,  interaction,  transparency  and community  
partnership  as firm principles , in line with the reform  approach  of His Majesty  the King,  
and the Economic  Vision  2030  and its principles  based  on sustainability,  fairness  and 
competitiveness . 
 
Mr President,  
 
The Kingdom  of Bahrain,  under  the leadership  of His Majesty  the King,  and the support  
of His Royal  Highness,  the Crown  Prince  and the Prime  Minister,  is continuing  its reform  
and diplomatic  approach  that supports  international  partnership  in consolidating  the 
values  of peace,  tolerance  and peaceful  coexistence,  rejecting  extremism,  hatred  and 
terrorism,  promoting  and protecting  human  rights  and supporting  sustainable  
development  and service  to humanity,  calling  on the permanent  members  of the UN 
Security  Council  to de-escalate  and to work  on resolving  disputes  through  dialogue  and 
diplomatic  means.  It also calls on all countries  to reaffirm  their commitment  to the values  
of tolerance,  coexistence,  mutual  respect  and dialogue,  and to intensify  their work  
together  to confront  and overcome  all challenges,  for the good  and happiness  of all 
humanity  and for their rights  to build  a better  future  in which  safety , peace  and tranquillity  
prevail.  
 
 
I wish you, Mr. President,  success  in your presidency  of the current  session  of the United  
Nations  General  Assembly,  and in strengthening  constructive  cooperation  between  
Member  States  in partnership  with the United  Nations  and its main  bodies  and agencies,  
in order  to face the current challenges , as well as taking  joint action  for the sake  of a world  
that enjoys  security  and peace,  and is filled with growth  and prosperity.  
 
Thank  you, Mr. President.", BHR,2022
 DNK_77_2022," 
 Mr President  of the General Assembly, Mr. Secretary General, 
distinguished delegates of  fellow member states,  
As we gather for the 77th opening of the General Assembly, the 
unique and indispensable convening power  of the UN is evident 
for all to see.   
Having listened  to speeches from around the world, it is equally 
clear that the UN Charter  continues to inspire and fill us with 
hope for a better world.  
And still, our world is in crisis. We are – in the words of the 
Secretary -General – “gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction ”.  
*** 
Six month ago, war erupted again in Europe. Unprovoked, Russia 
attacked Ukraine  – a shared neighbour of Russia and Europe. The 
military aggression is a vicious onslaught  on the people of 
Ukraine. Their resilience and bravery in the face of brutality is 
awe-inspiring.  
Throughout the week, we have heard many perspectives on th e 
Russian aggression . We have heard the concerns of fellow 
member states , geographically remote from the war,  worried 
about being caught in the middle of a new cold war. And w e have 
heard the despair  over the consequences on food supplies  and 
energy prices worldwide.  We acknowledge these concerns.  But Indlæg  ved åbningen af FN’s 77. Generalforsamling

 also feel the need to stress, that they are caused by the Russ ian 
aggression. Not by international sanctions.  
Importantly, we  have heard no one – apart from a few self -
interested voices - denying the evident: that Russia ’s aggression 
against Ukraine is a direct violation of the UN Charter.  
Let me be clear: Russia’s invasion of a neighbour ing state . 
President Putin ’s blatant  imperial ambitions. His horrifying 
allusions to using nuclear weapons. These are unprecedented 
threats against  not only Europe , but international  peace and 
security. We are extremely concerned.  
So yes. W e rally fellow member states to take a stand for the 
territorial integrity of Ukraine . Just as Denmark  has stood up in  
support of the independence and sovereign ty of other nations 
throughout the hi story of the United Nations. Against apartheid 
and for decolonization.  
This is an appeal to all member states to stand firmly on the side 
of the UN Charter. To fight back  against an international 
disorder, where might makes  right.  
We appeal to the rest of the world to see Russia’s aggression for 
what it is: an attempt to expand its own territory by force . This is 
completely unacceptable . Not just to European neighbours, who 
rightly worry that we could be next in line, if Putin has his way in 
 Ukraine. But for all who believes in the sanctity of the Charter 
and the principles of territorial integrity and political 
independence of sovereign states.  
We appeal for your understanding . A war in our back yard . Raged 
by a permanent member of the Security  Council and a nuclear 
power . The influx of millions Ukranian refugees to Europe . This  
will obviously tap a great deal  of our resources and political 
focus . This will inevitably be the case  until the territorial integrity 
of Ukr aine is restored  and respected .  
*** 
This being said , we do not neglect other crises and global 
challenges . We know that our other joint challenges remain – and 
have in many cases been aggravated  by the Russian act of 
aggression.   
The most pressing crises of our time are  all truly global. Climate, 
pandemic, violent conflict, instability, forced displacement, food 
insecurity. We feel them everywhere. Regardless of where we 
live. In our every -day life as the price of food and ene rgy rises. 
Rising inequality . As extreme weather and climate -induced 
disasters hit.  
Yet, even as these events affect us all, there is no doubt, that they 
are felt most strongly by the most vulnerable, the most fragile and 
 the poorest  among us. Developing countries are - unfairly and  
unjust - hit the hardest by the global crises of our time .  
This was - and is – clearly the case with COVID19 . The  lingering 
repercussions of the pandemic continue to inflict human and 
economic wounds on societies in the Global South.  
Collectively, w e must do more to address both the problems at 
hand and the fund amental imbalances of the world we share. And 
we must do it now. For the sake of both current and future 
generations.   
None of us can steer through pandemics or counter the climate 
crisis alone. And nor should we.  
In the 21th century, it is – or rather, it should be – clear to us all 
that the future we share depends on solidarity. And on our ability 
to address and overcom e the fault lines and divisions that 
increasingly drive us apart. Solidarity is an investment. In 
prosperity. In security. In peace.  In this regard, Denmark is one of 
very few countries that lives up to the UN target of 0,7 percent. 
We have done so for mor e than forty years.  
Today, more than anything we need climate solidarity .  
The industrialized world must acknowledge our responsibility to 
deliver on the climate crisis. Climate solidarity means climate 
financing . As Denmark strives to reduce our own footp rint, we 
 have made major global commitments on climate adaptation and 
climate financing .  
We have massively scale d up Danish grant -based climate finance 
to at least 500 million USD a year by 2023. We are dedicating 60 
percent to adaptation in poor and vuln erable countries.  And we 
are strengthening our efforts to mobilize public and private 
finance from other sources.  In total, Denmark aims to contribute 
at least 1 percent of the collective target of 100 billion dollars.  
Way above our relative share.  
And w e call on others to follow. And to do so urgentl y. If a small 
country like Denmark can, the G20 can.  
We also need to step up  and listen to those affected the most by 
climate -induced damage s.  
We were proud to be the first contributor to the Santiago Network  
at COP26 and this week we have followed up with several new 
initiatives for those hardest hit and the world’s poorest .  
As we look towards COP27, Denmark will also be among the 
founding memb ers of the Systems Observations Financing 
Facility . An initiative, taken by Secretary -General Guterres to 
ensure that early warning services reach everyone in the next five 
years. 
 It is a small step . But it is important. Because it will make a 
difference i n the lives of people and societies living on the brink.  
*** 
The UN ’s most essential task is to save the world from the 
scourge of war. This might sound like a lofty ideal, but in 
essence, it is about providing  the space for the difficult 
conversations, restoring trust, finding  the spaces  for common 
ground on those issues  where we stand far apart.  
The UN needs to deliver on this. But the  UN is all of us, and the  
UN is only as good as what we as member states put into it. We 
all need to put in the work and take responsibility to ensure that 
the trenches between us do not g row deeper . We can not freeride 
on multilateralism. We must not neglect to maintain and protect 
the global common that the United Nations is.  Denmark is ready 
to do our part.  
Just a few hours ago , Denmark announced that we are running for 
a seat in the Un ited Nations Security Council for the period of 
2025 -26.  
If elected to the Security Council, Denmark will do all we can to 
help ensure that the Council fulfils its vital mandate of 
maintaining international peace and security. 
 As a small country with a lo ng history of global engagement and 
international solidarity, Denmark takes pride in being a bridge -
builder . We know – simply by virtue of our smallness – that if we 
want to achieve anything, we must work with others. And we 
must do so on the basis of part nership and dialogue.  
We pursue cooperation where all voices are heard . We  seek 
honest conversations with partners about the challenges we face. 
And we work to find ways of confronting them together. This is 
the spirit of cooperation, we hope to bring to the  Security 
Council.  
*** 
The candidature  is a natural extension of our long standing and 
unwavering commitment to multilateralism in general and to the 
United Nations in particular.  
We all need a UN -system that is fit for the future and able to 
deliver effectively for today. Denmark is a long -time advocate for 
UN reforms – both a t the highest level and in the every -day 
workings of the organization.  
We championed the reform of the UN development system. We 
continue to support the implementation of the reforms, both 
financially and politically. 
 Earlier this week , we launch ed the Pledge to Predictable 
Payments  initiative . It is a small, yet pragmatic step; paving the 
way for a UN better able to act. We urge you all to help the UN 
help us all, by recommi tting to the goal of making our payment 
patterns predictable and transpar ent. Giving the UN predictability 
is a small act with no cost to us as individual member states, but 
it is of significant value to the United Nations’ ability to serve us.  
The UN, however, also needs more fundamental reform. In 
particular, it needs a UN Security Council that bet ter reflect s the 
world of today.  During the 76th General Assembly, Denmark co -
facilitated the inter -governmental negotiations of Security 
Council reform. We will continue to advocate for reform towards 
a more accountable, represent ative, transparent and effective 
Council.  
This also means  that even as we call on fellow member states to 
stand up for the UN Charter and its universal principles and 
aspirations, we must not settle for simply defending the status 
quo. We need to do more. We need to do better. And we need to 
do it together.  
The good news is that we know what needs to be done. The UN 
Secretary General has presented us with a sobering analysis of the 
state of the world in “Our Common Agenda” and presented a 
clear path forward. Denmark fully supports the SG’s vision and 
 remains unwavering in our commitment to a revitalized 
multila teralism with the UN at the centre.   
We look forward to working with fellow member states in 
translating the vision into reality. And we will do our part to 
ensure that we – as a collective – make the most of the upcoming 
“sister summits” : the SDG Summit i n September 2023 and the 
Summit of the Future in 2024 .  
Because these two agendas – the 2030 Agenda and Our Common 
Agenda – are mutually reinforcing . The twin agendas and the 
sister summits provides us not only with a sense of direction, but 
also with the tools to get there. If we work together.  
 
Moving forward - together – on the twin agenda s of these 
summits provides a way out of the current gridlock of global 
dysfunction. A way for us to live up to the expectations of future 
generations.  
And let us not forget that t his remains the Decade of Action. 
Let’s act!

H.E. President J osé Ramos -Horta  
of the Democratic Republic of Timor -Leste  
at the 77th Session  
of the United Nations  General Assembly  
 
23rd September 2022  
 
 
Mr. President,  
Sr. Secretario -General,   
Excelências,   
 
It is an honour to return to this Assembly of Nations once again as President of my 
country for which I was re -elected five months ago.   
 
Since then, I have focused on our domestic agenda, building bridges with the 
Executive, Legislative and Judiciary branches, engaging urba n and rural 
communities, youth and students, civil society, religious leaders, professionals, 
farmers, traders, private and banking sectors to consolidate inclusive peace and 
security, nourish our lively democracy and democratic institutions, and reenergis e 
our feeble economy.   
 
We are rated best performing democracy in Southeast Asia (Freedom House, 
Washington, and Economist, UK) and number 17 in Media Freedom (Reporters 
Without Borders, Brussels).   
 
Democracy and Sustainable Development must progress together, both have to be 
all inclusive, embracing every age group, youth, women and men. All segments ofthe society must enjoy equal opportunities and see tangible outcomes of their 
participation in the  democratic process.   
 
My Presidency is an open one, with no iron gates and no armed security. It is 
accessible to everyone, particularly children, who have unrestricted access to the 
presidential grounds with a special swimming pool built for them, and a center for 
after school activities like learning music, singing, reading, painting, games, 
computers, etc.   
 
Half of my monthly salary of less than $5,000 (after tax) is donated to destitute 
families. I have not authorized purchase of new vehicles for the Presidency and no 
member of my staff is assigned an official car. For this UNGA session I brought a 
delegation of seven and we all stay in the cheapest hotel we could find near the 
UN.  
 
Working with the Government, National Parliament and international pa rtners, we 
are committing ourselves to seriously confront extreme poverty, child malnutrition 
and stunting. To confront stunting and malnutrition we are actively promoting 
breastfeeding, aiming to drastically reduce the use of artificial baby formulae, 
providing cash and in kind support for pregnant women and mothers, expanding 
early childhood education.  
 
This is a moral and ethical challenge.   This is our collective commitment.   
 
Like almost every country on the Planet, Timor -Leste endured multiple climat e 
change catastrophes, prolonged dry season, followed by floods, the Covid -19 
pandemic, and now the global economic impact of Russia -Ukraine -NATO 
confrontation.   
 
We had minimal direct impact of the Covid -19 pandemic in terms of 
hospitalisations and fatali ties. More children died of dengue than of COVID -19. But 
the policies we undertook to prevent the spread of the insidious virus, such as 
curtailing free movement of peoples and goods, inevitably impacted on the 
livelihood of rural and urban people across t he country. Farmers and traders 
suffered the most.To protect our children we close down schools even though we knew that this 
decision would have serious detrimental consequences for the hundreds of 
thousands of our children and youth who had to miss sc hool, and missed out on 
the ""one meal a day"" program, which provides a meal for every child in schools 
across the country.   
 
In the very early days of the onset of the pandemic, our health authorities and WHO 
and other UN Agencies on the ground, scrambled,  worked hard day and night to 
prevent the much feared virus from killing our people.  Thanks to the prompt 
actions taken by the Government, supported by our partners and friends we 
avoided a public health crisis.   
 
Australia proved to be a true sisterly nei ghbour promptly delivering every 
assistance our fragile health system required. We are deeply grateful for the speedy 
generous action taken by the Australian government in deploying medical 
specialists, ventilators and entubation equipment, and training lo cal staff. When a 
vaccine became available Australia provided us beyond our needs enabling the 
vaccination of more than 72% of our people, including children.   
 
Government and civil servants, who at times move at a tropical leisurely pace, 
quickly drafted a COVID -19 prevention and economic recovery strategy which 
included cash transfers and food baskets for every low income household.   
 
We are grateful to COVAX for the initial shipments of vaccines. We are grateful to 
New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Ja pan, China, the EU, Portugal and the US, for 
their generous support in kind and cash. And all our friends cited above had a worse 
pandemic to contend with in their own cities. Yet they didn't forget us.   
 
UN agencies - UNDP, WHO, UNICEF, WFP and others - performed admirably in close 
coordination among them and in partnership with Government sectoral agencies 
and international partners.   
 
To all we are profoundly indebted.  
 
In a world plagued with conflicts and man made catastrophes, from Myanmar to 
Afghanistan to Yemen to Ukraine, Timor -Leste is an oasis of tranquillity. Commoncriminality is very low, armed robbery is unheard of. We do not have organized 
crime.  
 
Our Catholic population  and Protestant and M uslim brothers and sisters 
communities live side by side in total harmony. Timor -Leste does not have a single 
case of ethnic or religious based tension and conflict.   
 
Working with the Secretariat of the Higher Committee of Human Fraternity 
established in February 2019 to mark the historic meeting in Abu Dhabi between 
Pope Francisco and the Grand Imam of Al -Azhar, Professor Ahmed Al -Tayeb, where 
the two world leaders signed the Document on Human Fraternity, I submitted the 
said Document to our National Parl iament immediately after my election. This was 
voted unanimously as a National Document that will be adapted as part of our 
school curriculum. Timor -Leste, the second most Catholic country in the world, 
became the first country to officially adopt the Decl aration on Human Fraternity.   
This kind of interfaith initiative is, I believe, relevant to the High Level event marking 
the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious 
and Linguistic Minorities held this week.  
 
In recen t weeks, upon taking office, I visited our two closest neighbours and friends, 
Australia and Indonesia. In both countries I was extremely well received by my 
official hosts and the people. With our giant neighbours we have the closest 
possible relationship , encompassing all sectors, from A to Z.    I have already 
mentioned Australia’s outreach during COVID19, and want to give special 
recognition here to Indonesia’s partnership with us to achieve truth, reconciliation 
and friendship between our two countries and to cooperate on economic and 
educational issues.  
 
In the third week of October I will visit Cambodia at the invitation of His Majesty 
the King. Our friend Prime Minister Hun Sen who holds the rotating chairmanship 
of ASEAN is among our most ardent advo cates for ASEAN membership. In the first 
week of December I will visit Vietnam and Singapore.   
 
With support from all ASEAN countries and its highly competent Secretariat, the 
UN, EU and ADB, we made significant progress in our preparation towards ASEAN 
accession.Senior expert missions from ASEAN, covering its three pillars - political -security, 
social -cultural and economic - have conducted thorough reviews of Timor -Leste 
ASEAN accession preparedness .  
 
Their reports support our own views and those of UN Agencies, Breton Woods 
institutions as well as ADB and foreign missions based in Díli that Timor -Leste has 
made significant strides since independence and that we should be welcome into 
ASEAN as its 11th member. We hope to become a full member in 2023.   
 
In 2023 Timor -Leste will hopefully gain WTO accession, another natural extension 
of our country's regional and global economic integration.  ASEAN and WTO 
accessions are driven by Timor -Leste's own economic interests, such as domestic 
economic reform process  to ensure healthy enabling environment for FDIs and 
national investment, and diversification of our economy.  
 
ASEAN membership is a strategic imperative, as important for TL's stability and 
prosperity as much as peace and prosperity in TL should matter to  ASEAN.  As much 
as peace and prosperity in our neighborhood benefits all, conflicts or threats of, 
and risks originating in one country inevitably impact on others.   
 
Mr. President,   
Mr. Secretary -General,  
Heads of State and of Government   
Ministers, Ambassadors,  
Ladies and Gentlemen   
 
At independence we successfully negotiated a revenue sharing agreement with 
Australia, and developed an important oil and gas field in the Timor Sea which 
generated substantial revenues for our treasury beginn ing in 2007.  It is with these 
revenues that we have being able to finance the development of much 
needed   infrastructures, port, airport, national and rural roads, schools, electricity, 
etc. The World Bank data notes that e lectricity now reaches more than 96% of the 
country.   
 
We are now engaged in sustained negotiations with our Joint Venture Partners to 
develop the Greater Sunrise gas field. Its development is central to our country’s 
future and the well -being of our people.At independence 20 years ago , we had 20 medical doctors, today we have more 
than 1,200 doctors for a population of 1,5 million. This would not have been 
realized without Cuban solidarity. At independence 20 years ago, life expectancy 
was less than 60, now a Timorese woman can expect to live beyond 71 years of 
age.   
 
Connectivity will surge in the next 3 -4 years as TL will be linked by several 
submarine cables to Australia, Indonesia and beyond. As it is, we already have a 
high percentage of mobile phone and social media users and are experimenting the 
exciting digital age and E -Goverment.   
 
Excellencies, I wish to now touch upon three matters of profound concern:   
 
The extremely serious food crisis affecting millions of people in Africa and Asia. I 
hope that  all have read carefully the  letter of our esteemed Secretary -General 
dated 31 August 2022 addressed to all Heads of State which provides with clinical 
precision exact figures on the number of our fellow human beings, women and 
children, youth and elderly, in several African countrie s, in Yemen and Afghanistan.  
The World Bank’s Food Commodity Price Index, which reached a record high in 
nominal terms during March -April 2022, went  up by 15 percent between April and 
May 2022,  and is more than 80 percent higher than two years ago. Add to this the 
recent devastating floods in Pakistan inflicting heartbreaking suffering on over 30 
million people , with over 7 million people displaced,  and causing widespread total 
destruction.  Crisi s on top of crisis.  Our deepest sympathy goes to the people of 
Pakistan.   
 
Excellencies,  
 
Aid to poorer countries of the South should not be cancelled out to be reallocated 
to address the refugee crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. In 2015, donor countrie s 
reallocated their ODA commitments to the North African, Syrian , Afghan  and Iraqi 
refugee crisis flowing into Europe , causing an estimated 15 percent drop in total 
aid.  The potential for a diversion of aid is even greater now, after 349 billion dollars 
were estimated as needed for the reconstruction of Ukraine.  We must ensure that 
the Ukrainians are supported, but not at the expense of unity with the many 
struggling people in other nations.In the aftermath of the 2008 -2009 subprime crisis which had knock on effect across 
the globe, hundreds of billions of dollars were quickly mobilized to rescue exposed 
European and American banks. Draconian fiscal austerity measures in the form of 
cuts in public expenditure and higher taxes were forced on the worker s and middle 
class in the crisis affected Western countries.   
 
But rarely are we  able to inspire the rich to show the same level of compassion and 
wisdom towards the poorer South. I always believe that we are all part of the great 
Human Family. Yet some se em to feel that we are not really equal, we are not part 
of the same human family, since part of the world lives in dazzling citadels, while 
their billions of distant relatives live in poor global neighborhoods.   
 
The WEOG countries started of f on high moral ground in confronting Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine but may end up losing the support of the developing world 
which after all are 80% of the global population.  
 
They should pause for a moment to reflect on the glaring contrast in their respo nse 
to the wars elsewhere where women and children have died by the thousands from 
wars and starvation. The response to our beloved Secretary -General’s cries for help 
in these situations have not met with equal compassion.   As countries in the Global 
South , we see double standards.   Our public opinion does not see the Ukraine war 
the same way it is seen in the North.    
 
And we are now faced with a ruinous situation in terms of the rising cost of living 
for the poor.  This has already resulted in riots in Sri Lanka, Peru, Kenya and most 
recently Haiti.  Low income countries were able to spend only a fraction of the 
amounts  spent by high income countries on COVID19 stimulus packages – 20 
percent  of GDP for high income countries, 6 percent for middle income and 2 .5 
percent for low income.  
 
As a result, many countries had to increase their debt.  Debt levels now limit us in 
protecting the weakest and most vulnerable from the effects of rising prices , let 
alone allow us to increase our efforts to address the climate emergency which 
threatens our very existence .  The number of developing countries in debt distress 
or at high ris k has doubled since 2015, to 60 percent.  Governments in the North 
need to respond faster to create the financing packages needed to protect againstthe double economic shocks of COVID19 and the Ukraine war – we need less talk 
and more action.  
 
But equally  I want to address our cries for solidarity and fraternity to the billionaires 
and trillionaires of Asia, África and Latin America. There’s more liquidity in Asia than 
in Europe and USA combined. It is time for the richest families and corporations of 
the so-called Global South to gather in a historic Summit, hosted by our esteemed 
Secretary -General, to commit themselves to a vision and plan of action to rid Asia, 
África and Latin America of extreme poverty, child malnutrition, provide clean 
water and sanit ation to every poor community, vaccines and basic public health, 
better education facilities, and better housing with renewable energy and 
connectivity for better access to education and business.  
 
This can be done by the rich of the global South....all it requires is vision, great 
hearts, audacity and understanding that investing on the poor of our own countries 
we are investing in Peace, in equality and prosperity for all. The rich will be richer 
and will live with inner bliss from the magnitude of their great deeds. The hundreds 
of millions freed from the shackles of poverty will create immense dividends for 
all.  
 
Abysmal leadership failures in Western and in Developing countries in resolving 
tens ions and differences have result ed in endless wars and death of innocent 
women and children. Human induced Climate change and unprecedented natural 
catastrophes are destroying livelihoods of tens of millions across the 
globe.   Globally, we missed an opport unity to resolve the COVID19 conflict through 
vaccine justice and cooperation rather than vaccine nationalism and competition.  
 
The people of Myanmar feel abandoned, betrayed, by the so -called international 
community. They ask, why the difference in treatm ent, prompt and extremely 
generous support for Ukrainian civilians and refugees, so much sophisticated 
military support for Ukraine resistance, and such a mute reaction to the war waged 
against the people of Myanmar?  But they are still fighting on and dyin g.  
 
The Myanmar conflict is impacting the security and stability of  neighbouring 
countries. It may escalate.There has to be dialogue by all involved in the conflicts  in Ukraine , in Myanmar  and 
in other crises around the world . The Tatmadaw cannot claim it is defending itself 
from external aggression.  In the Ukraine conflict, Russia and Ukraine should clear 
their ports and sea routes and allow normal resumption of permitted international 
shipping activities, following on the breakthrough in the grain and fertilizer 
agreements brokered by the Secretary General.  This is the kind of action we need 
to see even more of from the UN, it strengthens its credibility with all our people.   
 
As there are extremely limited number of credible neutral global leaders, th e UN 
Secretary -General and high Envoys of his choice should work hard day and night to 
reach a humanitarian ceasefire agreement, and provisional peace agreement.  The 
ultimate goal will have to be a comprehensive, permanent peace agreement. What 
it should b e aimed now is a temporary cessation of troop movements, military 
action, humanitarian air and land corridors and zones for unimpeded humanitarian 
assistance and resumption of export and import activities.   
 
Russia, Ukraine and NATO countries have to swall ow their pride, review their past 
policies that led to this mutual suicide, back away from each other borders, let 
Ukrainians rebuild their country and lives, let Russians retreat with security to their 
borders.

 STATEMENT BY H.E  
THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS  
MR. NICOS ANASTASIADES  
GENERAL DEBATE OF THE 77TH SESSION  
UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
 
Mr. President, Excellencies,  Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
With only a few months left of my 10 -year tenure in office, I stand 
before you to address the plenary session of the General Assembly 
for the very last time .  
 
I would have wished nothing more than for this address to have 
been a reflection of positive developments  in what humanity has 
had to face or is facing .  
 
Like all of you, I would have liked to have applauded the results of 
the implementation either of the provisions of the UN Charter or of 
the decisions and resolutions of the General Assembly and the 
Security Council, w hich would have assured that: 
 (i) Any threats or attempts to bring into question the sovereignty 
and territorial integrity of any UN M ember -state had been brough t 
to a complete halt  or minimized .  
 
(ii) That long – standing conflicts and disputes had been resolved 
or where in the process of being resolved , in accordance with  the 
decisions and resolutions of the UN.  
 
(iii) That the need for the Organization’s reform would have led to 
the effective prevention of new threats and challenges to world 
peace.  
 
(iv) That through its new role the UN would have implemented 
projects  to effectively co mbat hunger and to improve the living 
conditions of hundreds of millions  of people in dire need of aid.  
 
(v) That the number of refugees and migrants forced to flee from 
their homes , due to conflict or poverty , would have been greatly 
reduced.  
 
That further: 
 (vi) We would have been able to tackle social and economic 
exclusion, lack of adequate health care standards and shortage of 
educational opportunities.  
 
(vii)  That s ustainable development would have finally become a 
reality for all countries and regions in need, by establishing the 
necessary political and socio -economic conditions which would 
have led to stability, economic growth and institution building.   
 
(viii)  That m easures for the prevention of climate change and its 
devastating consequences would have been implemented 
consistently by  all parties involved.  
 
(ix) That t errorism and religious fundamentalism would have 
given way to tolerance and understanding.  
 
(x) That t he trillions of dollars spent on destructive weapons 
would instead have been spent on actions and programmes aiming 
to bridge the gap between rich and poor s tates.  
 
(xi) And finally, that m ultilateralism would  have  been the guiding 
doctrine of all states. 
 Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
In addressing the General Assembly in 2018 and referring to the 
weakness of dealing with the same problems , I had wondered and 
I quote:  
 
“How is it then that we come back again and again, year after year, 
as a kind of ritual, to attest to the dismal lack of effectiveness for 
some and the embellishment attempt for others, for what is in fact 
our inability to fulfill the aims of the UN Charter?  
 
Why do the decisions of the Security Council remain in their 
overwhelming majority sheer certificates attesting vi olations?  
 
Why is international law and international agreements not 
implemented?  
 
Why do strategies and programmes , aiming at creating better 
conditions for people that are suffering, remain wishful thinking? ” 
 Esteemed friends,  
 
Although I am well aware that  what I am about to say is well known 
to all of you, for the sake of history I cannot but relay some  truths 
which are leading to a declining path  and gradual loss of credibility 
of the United Nations.  
 
An Organisation  which  was formed  right  after  the Secon d World  
War to prevent  new disasters,  cement  peace,  provide  protection  
and hope  to those  in need  of effective  protection  and action  against  
all the challenges  I have  already  mentioned.   
 
I know that what I am saying may be outside the bounds of 
diplomatic etiquette, but I do believe that the obligation of each 
leader before history is not to overlook failings and shortcomings 
in favour of wishful thinking or  flattery.   
 
That  is why I will proceed  with a review,  not just of the reasons  
which  have  transformed  the Organisation  into a repository  of 
problems,  but also to what  states  are required  to do in order  to 
provide  credibility  to the Organisation,  as well as the ability  to 
effectively  impo se international  legal  order  or to consistently  
implement  decisions  and programmes  for the benefit  of humanity. 
 Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
In my opinion,  the weaknesses  and inefficacies  of the UN is due to: 
 
1.  The fact that international  law is preceded  by financial  or 
other  interests  of powerful  member  states.    
 
2. That  despite  the end of the Cold  War,  alliances  based  on 
comm on interests  lead to tolerance  towards  states  which  violate  
international  law, if the offender  is under  their  sphere  of influence.  
 
3. The resurgence  of hegemonic  tendencies  by some  states  
with the aim of creating  new empires,  at the expense  of smaller  
states  and in violation  of international  law.   
 
4. Despite  the declared  intention  of the Secretary  – General  of 
the UN to proceed  with the much  needed  reform  and 
modernization  of the Organisation , as well as its modus  operandi  
and decision -making  processes,  the lack of willingness  on the part 
of the aforementioned  states  has not allowed  for the 
implementation  of such  a change. 
 5. As a result  of the same  political  expediencies , the UN, 
unfortunatel y, adopt s an equal -distance  stance,  even  when  faced  
with the violation  of decisions,  resolutions  and defined  scope  and 
terms  of reference  specified  to the Secretariat.  
 
This results  in emboldening  offending  states,  which  not only 
disregard  international  law, but also create  new precedents  outside  
the framework  of legality.   
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
I have  set out the main  reasons  for the lack of effectiveness  and 
also the weakness  of the UN to live up to the expectations  of 
billions  of people.  
 
I know I may be considered as a romantic ideologist, but I believe 
that recent events  and problems affecting the world, do not leave 
any choice other than taking bold, but necessary decisions, such 
as: 
 
(a)  Identification of the causes that lead to unnecessary rivalries  
and conflicts and renewal of our commitment to a global order 
based on int ernational law: 
 A global order which ensures that peace, security, human rights 
and sustainable development remain the highest values which we 
undertake to preserve and hold . 
 
(b) Political will and determination to proceed with the reform and 
modernization o f the UN to a just, effective and efficient multilateral 
governance system.  
 
And this reform and modernization process becomes even more 
imperative and urgent with the imminent danger after 77 years of a 
new World War, following the illega l invasion of Russia to Ukraine . 
 
Distinguished friends,  
 
My reference  to the need  for reforms  to the structure  and 
implementation  mechanism  of decisions  taken  by the UN does  not 
only arise  from  my assessment  as to other  international  problems,  
but also from  what  my country  still endures  and suffers  as a result  
of the Turkish  invasion  of Cyprus  in 1974.   
 
It is with deep disappointment that I heard President Erdogan  
claim ιng that, and I quote: “ As Turkey w e want  all issues  in the 
Aegean  Sea and the Eastern  Mediterranean to be solved within the 
 framework of good neighbourly relations and in conformity with 
international law”.  
 
How  provocative  and ironic  is it for the Turkish  President to put 
forward such a claim, when he threatens to overtake Greek island s 
or when he commits thousands of violations of the airspace of a 
sovereign and neighbouring , contrary to international law?   
 
How even more provocative is it to express the desire to resolve 
disputes “in  conformity  with international  law” , when he refuses to 
implement numerous resolutions  of the United  Nations  on the 
Cyprus Pro blem and creates new  fait accomplis ?  
 
How much in conformity with international  law is his refusal to 
abide by:  
 
(a)  The General Assembly Resolution 3212 adopted in October 
1974 , which urges the speedy withdrawal of all foreign armed 
forces and foreign military presence and personnel from the 
Republic of Cyprus and the cessation of all foreign interference in 
its affairs. 
 (b) A resolution which  was endorsed by the Security Council 
Resolution 365 in December of the same year.  
 
(c) The Security Council R esolution  1251 of 1999 which reaffirms 
its position that a Cyprus settlement must be based on a State of 
Cyprus with a single sovereignty and interna tional personality and 
a single citizenship, with its independence and territorial integrity 
safeguarded, in a bi -communal and bi -zonal federation.  
 
It also stressed that such a settlement must exclude union in whole 
or in part with any other country or any form of partition or 
secession.  
 
Mr. Erdogan last year claimed that efforts should concentrate on 
reaching a settlement based on the so – called “realities on the 
ground”, whilst this year he spoke about the need for everyone to 
“see the truth” and that there are “two distinct states and two 
distinct peoples on the Island today”  
 
And I am wondering as to w hich truth is he  talking about?  
 
1. The truth that 37 per cent of the territory of the Republic of 
Cyprus, an EU member -state, remains under military occupation ? 
 2. The truth that aft er the Turkish invasion of 1974  one third of 
the Greek Cypriots were forced  to leave their ancestral homes?  
 
3.  The truth  that they have implanted hundreds of thousands of 
Turkish nationals to the occupied areas, thus , altering the 
demog raphic character of the island:  turning the Turkish Cypriots 
into minority in the areas they illegally occu py? 
 
4.  The truth  that Turkey has e stablished an illegal entity in the 
occupied areas, which is under its absolu te political, economic, 
social , cultural and religious control?  
 
An illegal entity described by the European Court of Human Rights 
as “a  subordinate  local  administ ration” of  Turke y? 
 
5.   The truth  that Turkey tries to equate the State, the 
internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus with the illegal 
secessionist entity? 
 6.   The truth  that the above proclamation of the purported 
secession had been condemned by the Security Council  and 
considered legally invalid?  
 
7.   The truth  that the Security Council called for its reversal and 
for all states and the international community as a who le, not to 
accept it or in any way assist it?  
 
8.   The truth  that they are trying to change the status of the 
fenced – city of Famagusta, contrary to the UN Council Resolutions  
550 and 789 ? 
 
9.  The truth that Turkey adopts its own arbitrary interpretation of 
international law which reduces the Exclusive Economic Z one of 
Cyprus by 44%, at the expense of both Greek Cypriots and Turkish 
Cypriots, contrary to the United Nations Convention on the Law of 
the Sea ? 
 Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
As I have noted earlier, when decisions or resolutions based on 
international law  are not to be implemented or enforced, then this, 
rightly so, could be perceived as fostering or even rewarding 
arbitrariness.  
 
This is what  we are actually  witnessing  today  with the Cyprus  
Problem. Turkey , which systematically violates international law, 
calls on the international community to recognize its illegal fait 
accomplis.  
 
Esteemed friends,  
 
Unfortunately, this was the long -standing aim of T urkey, ever 
since 1956.  
 
That is why , despite historic al compromises by the Greek Cypriot 
side,  all efforts on reaching a settlement on the Cyprus Problem 
failed as a result of the  intransigent stance and irrational demands 
of Turkey. 
 The latest example being the Conference on Cyprus held at Crans  
Montan a in July 2017, during which , as regards the internal 
aspects of the Cyprus Problem, the UN Secretary -General 
assessed in his report on 28 September 2017 that : 
 
 “The core outstanding issues related to governance and power -
sharing remained few” and that “by the time the Conference 
closed, the sides had essentially solved the key issue of effective 
participation”.  
 
Thus, whilst the aim of the Secretary – General to reach a strategic 
agreement was within close reach, the reason of the unsuccessful 
outcome was Turkey’s inflexible stance and insistence on 
maintaining the anachronistic Treaty of Guarantee, the right of 
intervention and a permanent presence of troops.  
  
And I would like to recall the UN Secretary – General’s Statement 
of June 2017 , in which he stressed that :  
 
“Progress in this Chapter  of Security and Guarantees  is an 
essential element in reaching an overall agreement”. 
 Following a period of stalemate and despite our disappointment, 
we undertook new initiatives to resume the proces s from where it 
was left off at Crans Montana, culminating to the Joint 
Understanding reached with the UN Secretary – General and the 
Turkish Cypriot leader on November 25, 2019, which reaffirmed the 
principles for the resumption of a new round of talks.  
 
Namely: The Joint Declaration of 11 February 2014, the prior 
convergences and the six - point framework the UN Secretary – 
General presented at Crans Montana.  
 
Regrettably, once again, Turkey undermined the prospect of 
resuming the negotiating process an d instead, in the meeting held 
in Geneva in April 2021, they presented their position for changing 
the agreed basis of a settlement from a federal solution to a two -
state solution.  
 
Nonetheless, our side undertook another initiative , which also led 
to a new joint meeting of the leaders of the two communities with 
the UN Secretary – General in September 2021, during which it was 
agreed that he would proceed with the appointment of a n Envoy, 
 in order to deliberate with both sides and al l interested parties so 
as to reach common ground for a new peace process to resume.  
 
Yet again, Turkey refused to uphold the said agreement.  
 
We also continued taking initiatives to break the impasse, through 
the letter I sent to the Turkish Cypriot lead er in May 23, 2022, by 
which I conveyed constructive proposals for the adoption of win - 
win Confidence Building Measures .  
 
Measures  which were immediately rejected b y the Turkish Cypriot 
side, which submitted counter -proposals in line with their aim for 
a two -state solution.  
 
Based on the above -mentioned , I believe that it is clear that the 
Greek Cypriot community has exerted and will continue to exert 
every possible effort  for the resumption of the talks , in order  to 
reach a settlement based on the United Nations Resolutions. 
 And as I  have emphasized, the only way forward in resolving 
conflicts and for peace to prevail is none other than the 
unwavering adherence to international law and the UN Charter, not 
as arb itrarily interpreted by those who seek to disguise their 
revisionist aspirations.  
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
During my ten -year tenure I might not have been able to enjoy what 
the vast majority would have also wished : The necessary reforms 
of the international Organisation, the resol ution of international 
conflicts and tackling challenges that affect hundreds of millions 
of people, such as hunger, poverty and climate change.  
 
I might have not been able to see my homeland reunited , with my 
Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot compatriots living in conditions 
of peace , prosperity  and stability.  
 
However, I earnestly hope that during my lifetime, I will be able to 
witness a better and more s table future for humanity. 
 I thank you very much for your attention.", CYP,2022
EU_77_2022,"Speech by  
President of the European Council  
Charles Michel  
at the 77th session  
of the UN General Assembly  
23 September 2022  
 
President, Secretary -General, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,  
In Senegal last December I met passionate doctors and researchers committed to 
saving lives. Thanks to international cooperation, they have set up a vaccine production 
centre at the Institut Pasteur, equipped with the most promising technologies.  
A few mon ths later, I met children in Borodianka, Ukraine. I saw in their eyes the horror 
of war, hearing stories of violence against women. Rape. Torture. Mass graves. 
Purveyors of death…  
Hope in Dakar... Horror in Borodianka...Putting an end to horror and choosin g hope: this 
is the promise of the United Nations. It was the foundation stone for the European 
Union. And hope is what we want for the whole world.  
That is why the European Union is extending a hand to all those who want to cooperate 
for the common good. To honour the UN’s promise.  
I want to speak about hope. But regrettably I will first speak to you about a war.  
Every war is a denial of humanity. And all suffering deserves the same engagement in 
response, whether in Yemen, Ethiopia, the Sahel, Myanmar or Ukraine.  
The Kremlin launched a war against the Ukrainian people. And hundreds of millions of 
women, men and children are being targeted all over the world. Threatened with famine. 
Deprived of heating. Hit by soaring energy bills. The Kremlin is waging a hybrid war. A 
war that combines the violence of weapons with the poison of lies.  
The Kremlin claims that Russia’s security has been threatened by ‘the West’ for years. 
That is not true! The Kremlin is attempting – in vain, I hope – to mobilise the worldagainst an imaginary enemy. No- one has threatened, attacked or invaded Russia. And 
no-one, absolutely no- one, in Europe wanted a conflict with Russia. What interest would 
we have in putting the security and prosperity of everyone at risk? 
The second lie is th at this war seeks to prevent an alleged genocide of the Russian-
speaking people of Ukraine and ‘denazify’ the country.  
That is not true, and it is despicable. Genocide means concrete acts committed with the 
intention of eliminating, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic or religious group. So 
everyone, apart from the Kremlin, has failed to notice that massacres of Ukrainians are 
being perpetrated on a huge scale by other Ukrainians? And what kind of liberation 
leads to the killing to this very day of Russ ian-speakers and the devastation of the 
infrastructure of their cities?  
The third lie is that the aggression against Ukraine is merely a ‘special operation’, not a 
war. That is blatantly untrue. This is well and truly a war. And the mobilisation 
announced a few days ago of hundreds of thousands of reservists simply proves this. 
Banning the word ‘war’ by punishing its use with up to fifteen years in prison does not 
change what it is. It merely betrays its shameful nature. This war is an unprovoked, 
illegal a nd unjustified aggression which aims to change internationally recognised 
borders through force, and that is not acceptable. And because we must stop the 
Kremlin’s war machine, massive economic sanctions were unavoidable.  
This brings me to the fourth lie: that the sanctions are causing food and fertiliser 
shortages. That is not true! It was Russia which –  even before war broke out – 
unilaterally decided to drastically reduce its exports of grain and fertilisers, causing price 
volatility on the global market . It was Russia which decided to place a military blockade 
on the Black Sea ports, making maritime trade impossible.  
It was the European Union which opened the ‘solidarity lanes’, that have already 
allowed more than 10 million tonnes of food products to leave Ukraine by road. And it 
was the agreement reached by Secretary General Guterres that opened a maritime 
corridor in the Black Sea to help bring global prices down and start the resupply of 
Africa, the Middle East and Asia. And today it is the height of cynicism that the Kremlin 
is again threatening not to extend the agreement concluded with the UN. Once again, it 
is the most vulnerable countries which will be the main victims. In fact, there is a simple 
solution to end this food crisis that threatens us:  that Russia stops the war, withdraws 
from Ukrainian territory and lifts the blockade of ports.  
Ladies and gentlemen, Excellencies, in this web of lies one moment of frankness and 
sincerity stands out: a year ago, in a written statement, Vladimir Putin dec lared, on the 
basis of historical rantings, that Ukraine is neither a nation nor a legitimate state. This is 
what is behind his thinking. He is fooling no- one, and sham referendums will not change 
a thing.In 1963, when the Organization of African Unity was  founded in Addis Ababa, 
the first president of independent Mali, Modibo Keita, said the following:  ‘[I]mperialism is 
that manifestation of that will to domination of man over man, of a society over anothersociety, of a people over a people, and the desir e to impose at all costs one’s own way 
of thinking, one’s own way of life, and one’s own method of political and economic 
development on others’.  
Imperialism and revanchism. These are the bases for this war of colonisation which has 
Ukraine as its target, and which is deliberately flouting international law and the UN 
Charter, to the point of brandishing the threat of nuclear weapons and even using right 
now the largest nuclear plant in Europe as a military base. This must stop, it is not 
acceptable. We unreservedly support the efforts of IAEA director Rafael Grossi to 
restore security at the Zaporizhzhia plant.  
Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before y ou and solemnly say to you that the EU does not 
ask anyone to choose between East or West, North or South. But there is a choice to be 
made. The EU’s choice is for respect for borders over aggression. Cooperation over 
threats. The rules -based order over the rule of the strongest.  
In 1948, in this forum, one of the EU’s founding fathers, Belgian prime minister Paul -
Henri Spaak, directly addressed the Soviet Union:  ‘We are afraid. Because in this 
Assembly you have made yourselves the champions of the doctrine of absolute national 
sovereignty. And because we ask ourselves […] how an international organisation can 
fulfil the purposes assigned to it, if this obsolete and […] reactionary doctrine triumphs ’. 
Today, Russia is a source of fear. The Kremlin has brought war back to Europe. And it 
is behaving like a blackmailer.  
We cannot allow the actions of one of us to shake our staunch collective determination 
to act for the common good. The European Union is reaching out, sincerely and 
honestly. We have so many chal lenges to face together. The effects of the pandemic 
are painful, especially for the most vulnerable. The Human Development Index is sliding 
backwards. All too often, women’s and minorities’ rights are still trampled on, or their 
very existence is even denied. Natural extreme events are becoming more and more 
frequent, as has recently been the case, dramatically, in Pakistan and Nigeria. The 
faultlines are cracking open: between developed and developing countries, between 
democracies and authoritarian regim es. The faultlines are also widening in our different 
countries.  
Multilateral cooperation is collective intelligence in action. It is also the European 
Union’s DNA. The European Union works as a force for peace, development and the 
promotion of human rights. European leadership is about building solutions together 
with you. 
It is not for us to give lectures. There is no master, no pupil. It is in this spirit of 
cooperation that we act at the UN, G7 and G20 and everywhere else. That is why and it 
is with this spirit that we are reaching out with strategic partnerships.Together with our African partners, we have reset the parameters. Our partnership is 
truly forward -looking and one of equals. And here let me reiterate my call and support 
for the inclusion of the African Union in the G20.  
Japan and South Korea, for example,  are countries with which we share so much, and 
we are strengthening our relations every day.  
With India and ASEAN, we are expanding our areas of cooperation.  
Our ties with the Latin American continent are natural ones. We are counting greatly on 
the 2024 summit to give a new impetus to our relations.  
Together with the Gulf countries we are identifying our shared priorities and holding 
frank and regular dialogues on our differences.  
We hope that the emerging powers, including China, will participate sincerely in 
collective efforts for peace and development. We believe in maritime security. We 
believe in stability in the Taiwan Strait. We adhere to the One China policy. But we will 
not turn a blind eye to human rights violations. Especially in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.  
Ladies and gentlemen, we are in this forum, the United Nations, which brings together 
the peoples of the world, and we all know that a robust multilateral system requires 
mutual trust. However, the current system is not inclusive and is not suffic iently 
representative.  
Use of the veto should be the exception, but it is becoming the rule. Reform is needed, 
as a matter of urgency. Let me share with you this conviction: when a permanent 
member of the Security Council starts an unprovoked, unjustified war which has been 
condemned by the General Assembly, its suspension from the Security Council should 
be automatic.  
We support the Secretary -General’s proposals on the Common Agenda, and the 
Summit of the Future in 2024 must serve as a game changer.  
The European Union is committed to and stands by the people of the G5 for the Sahel. 
We are ready to develop resources for the Gulf of Guinea countries. We are also 
committed to and stand by Mozambique. We support the efforts of Rwanda and the 
SADC countries tha t are present here. And together with Josep Borrell, our High 
Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the European Union is sparing 
no effort to try to reinstate the Iran nuclear deal.  
The European Union stands by Afghans, especially Afghan  women. We will continue to 
fight everywhere this obscurantism, which tramples on the rights of women and girls on 
a daily basis in all areas. And I am thinking now of the women and girls in Iran who are 
standing up courageously to defend their dignity, at  the risk of their lives.In Yemen a serious humanitarian crisis is unfolding. Yemenis have a right to peace. We 
support the efforts of United Nations Special Envoy Grundberg to transform the current 
truce into a sustainable ceasefire.  
The peace agreements  between Arab countries and Israel are a step forward in the 
region. But the Palestinian people have been waiting too long, in vain, for the slightest 
progress for their own future. We must not lose sight of the Palestinian people in the 
global landscape. The two -state solution, with Israel and Palestine living in peaceful 
coexistence, in which the security of all must be guaranteed, remains a priority.  
Finally, I have personally taken on the role of difficult mediation between the President 
of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia. The fighting must stop. The goal must 
be to resolve the conflict in order to establish lasting peace and prosperity in the South 
Caucasus.  
Dear colleagues, leadership is about showing the way. But it is also about deliveri ng 
results.  
In terms of energy security, we have been far too dependent, for too long. We have 
jeopardised our security, prosperity and sovereignty.  
Energy and climate change are two sides of the same coin. Overcoming the energy 
crisis means mitigating the climate threat. Protecting our biodiversity and oceans is 
about safeguarding our future. Climate neutrality is the compass of the European Union 
and at COP27 in Sharm el Sheikh we will push unreservedly to implement the Paris 
pledges, and to go beyond. We want a just and fair transition. No one country can 
protect our planet on its own.  
The European Union is honouring its commitment to developing countries. And we 
expect all other developed countries to follow our example.  
Today, almost a fifth of humanity  is at risk of descending into poverty and famine. The 
Russian war against Ukraine has exacerbated this crisis. Initiatives are being taken, by 
the G7, by the European Union, by the African Union, and by others. The European 
Union is mobilising almost EUR 8 billion for food security between now and 2024.  
But we know more is needed: more coordination, more money and more sovereignty. 
New, more resilient and more equitable agricultural models are needed. More food 
sovereignty is essential, particularly in Afr ica and Latin America. We are ready to extend 
our hand to support sustainable projects for fertiliser production on those continents, as 
we have done for vaccines to protect against COVID.  
COVID -19 has opened our eyes to our strengths and our weaknesses. V accines were 
produced in record time. And under the leadership of WTO Director Okonjo- Iweala, a 
balance was struck between intellectual property, scientific innovation and universal 
access to technology.However, we know that we need to learn all the lessons from this painful pandemic. 
This is why Dr Tedros and I, some time ago, launched the idea of a pandemic treaty to 
strengthen global health security. Negotiations on the treaty are ongoing and must be 
concluded.  
Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude.  
We are well aware that we are living through a watershed moment in human history. 
Sometimes we have abused this word ‘watershed’; more than ever, we feel that the 
times we are living through are not ordinary or insignificant.  
And I think of Winston Churchill.  In 1946, referring to the failure of the League of 
Nations to avoid World War II, he said:  ‘The League did not fail because of its principles 
or concepts. It failed because those principles were deserted by those states which 
brought it into being, becaus e the governments of those states feared to face the facts 
and act while time remained.’  
Like the European Union, the United Nations is a project of hope, founded following the 
horrors of two world wars.  
A few days ago, my six -year-old daughter suddenly confided in her mother and me that 
she was afraid of war. And that sent shivers down my spine. No parent in the world can 
bear their child being afraid of war or even less their child being faced with it. No parent 
in the world can bear their chil d going hungry or unable to get medical treatment. No 
parent in the world can bear their child being deprived of hope of a dignified and fulfilling 
life. 
Forestalling or preventing horror in Borodianka, Yemen, Myanmar and elsewhere. 
Restoring hope, like th e doctors in Dakar, and elsewhere, is at the very heart of our 
responsibility as leaders representing the peoples of the world.  
Differences there will always be, but the same blood runs through our veins. The same 
heart beats within us. We have the same dr eams of education and freedom for boys 
and girls.  
I believe in the virtues of collective wisdom. I believe in science and in knowledge and 
that they will put the world back on the track of hope. We must step it up. And that step 
up must be taken now and it  must be taken together. You can count on the European 
Union. Thank you.

FIJI’s NATIONAL STATEMENT AT THE 77th SESSION OF  
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
 
General Assembly Hall, United Nations Headquarters, New York  
Friday 23 September 2022  
 
 
 
 
President of the U N General Assembly, Csaba Kőrösi; 
Secretary General, Antonio Guterres;  
Excellencies;  Ladies and Gentlemen.  
Bula Vinaka and good morning.  
First, I congratulate  you, Your Excellency Csaba K őrösi, on 
your election as the President of the General Assembly .Page 2 of 13 
 I also commend your predecessor, Foreign Minister Abdulla 
Shahid of the Maldives .  
In a year of challenge, I am here  to condemn not one  but 
three great global conflicts.  
The first is Russia’s war of aggression  on Ukraine  –– a scourge  
that reflects a  brutal  mentality of conquest and empir e. No 
matter their size , no matter their might , Fiji is unafraid to 
condemn any warring nation . We owe nothing less  to the 
Fijian  peacekeepers  who have sacrificed and paid the 
ultimate price for peac e’s sake  around the world . We in the 
Pacific , who have lived the horror of nuclear fallout , wholly 
denounce  Mr. Putin’s threatened  use of nuclear weapons.  
And I appeal to him: G ive diplomacy a chance to bring this 
war to a speedy  close.  
We too condemn another  war – the climate war – that 
humanity is waging  on itself, our ecosystems , and ocean. 
This war isn’t fought with bullets and bombs, but  apathy,  
denial , and a lack of courage  to do what we all know what 
must be done .Page 3 of 13 
 This is a war we  are losing  in every  community , city, and  
country of every size.  But small states, those least 
responsible, stand to  lose the most of all.  
Yet we  are not heard – not even , it seems,  by the leadership 
of some multilateral development banks . And so  lastly I 
condemn the cold war of indifference against  the citizens of 
small islands and states who bear the brunt  of this super -
storm  of global shocks, from rising commodity pric es, to the 
climate crisis and the pandemic.  
Surely, as leaders, we have the capacity to defend peace on 
all these  fronts. I ask:  where  is the world’s  courage  to do so ?  
I see that courage in the Fijian people I serve as  we build up 
our country  undaunted by these challenges . Today I will 
share  their story – not for  the sake of pride , but because 
leaders  should know  the lives, the progress, and the 
aspirations the y threaten  with their inaction.Page 4 of 13 
 I arrived this week  from the funeral of Her Majesty Queen 
Elizabeth II  - a leader who holds  a special place in Fijian  
history and in the hearts of the Fijian people , including my 
own.  
My fondest memory of Her Majesty was in London, four 
years ago, at a welcome reception she hosted at the 
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.  
She walked over to me from her greeting post to say that 
she had asked the then -Prince Charles to look after  their 
other guests so that she could personally welcome me and 
Fiji back into the Commonwealth.  
It was a simple gesture, but a special affirmation of all that 
we had worked to achieve for Fiji’s new and true 
democracy.  
For we  had done away with a n undemocratic  system that 
relegated  hundreds of thousands of Fijians to the margins of 
society  by design .Page 5 of 13 
 We had adopted a new  Constitution  that echoed  the spirit 
of the UN Charter ’s promise to  uphold equal right s for all  
peoples  regardless of background, religion,  ethnicity , 
gender, age, or physical ability or province .  
It guaranteed  common and equal Fijian identity and 
citizenship  for all citizens.  The strong and accountable 
institutions it established and the protections it upholds, 
produced an  electoral system in which every Fijian vote 
holds equal value. And the Fijian people have used that vote 
to elect my government twice in the last eight years.  
In our service , we have worked to advance  the civil, 
political, and socioeconomic constitutional rights of every 
Fijian –– from the protection of indigenous land ownership, 
to the right to clean water and adequate sanitation, the right 
to a clean and healthy environment, and the right to 
educatio n, among many  more.  
Since 2014, w e have built or replaced  hundreds of  kilometers  
of water pipelines  and improved access to clean water to 
over 80  percent of all Fijians .Page 6 of 13 
 Thousands of  Fijian households have gained access to electric 
power for the first time –– propelling  electricity access in the 
country upwards of 96%.  
We have replaced or outright built dozens of  bridges and 
crossings and lit up the country with  thousands of  new 
streetlights. We have built, upgraded, or rehabilitated close 
to 1,000 kilometers  of roads.  
Poverty is falling, incomes are rising.  
The cost of data has fallen by as much as 98% .  
95% of the Fijian population have mobile phone 
connectivity. And a national digital television platform, 
Walesi, reaches all 110 populated islands in Fiji.  
We achieved the longest stretch of economic growth in 
Fijian history.  
Among these wins for sustain able development, the Fijian 
education revolution is my greatest pride as Prime Minister.Page 7 of 13 
 For the first time in our history, primary and secondary 
education are free —not free in name, but free in fact and 
accessible to all. Textbooks are free.  
Whether they travel by road, river, or ocean, disadvantaged  
students ’ transportation to schools is subsidized.  We have 
extended opportunities for tertiary education beyond what 
was ever thought imaginable.  And, today , Fijian women 
outnumber men in our uni versities . 
In times of crisis , our constitutional commitment s to every 
Fijian have served us best and mattered most.  
The COVID -19 pandemic contracted our economy by  over 
20 percent.  It stole half of government revenues , flung over 
100,000 Fijians out of full-time employment , and pressed  us 
to the precipice  of a socioeconomic  crisis.  
Through decisive policy choices, we maintained the 
strongest possible focus on protecting people and 
communities. Though  our tourism revenue was zero – we 
paid out income support to the unemployed .Page 8 of 13 
 We did not slash a cent of our  pensions and payments to 
elderly  and disabled  Fijians . In total, we paid out half a 
billion dollars in social assistance  – the equivalent of ten 
percent of the value of our  GDP.  
With our partners support,  we achieved the near universal 
vaccination of our adult population .  
We re-opened  Fiji’s borders from this past Decembe r and we 
have since welcomed hundreds of thousands of  visitors  and 
earned hundreds of millions in revenue.   
More of our people are working again and we are set 
toward record -breaking double -digit economic growth for 
the Fijian economy this year.  
The pace of our  recovery  is possible because we prepared  
for it . We kept our  national airline, Fiji Airways, ready to 
resume full operations throughout the COVID crisis .  
We supported our tourism  industry to weather the storm. 
That allowed us to set the terms of our re -opening .Page 9 of 13 
 With our steady recovery, we are now paying out tens  of 
millions of dollars to help the most vulnerable Fijian families 
meet the globally -rising  cost of food , fuel, and other 
essentials.  
Excellencies, our eight-year-old democracy has delivered the 
equality our people cherish. It has delivered services and 
infrastructure they depend on.  
It certainly has also shown its resilience. Our eyes are now 
on the next eight years  – the sprint from  now until 2030  –– 
that will be most defining ever for our people s and planet’s  
future . 
If we do not halve carbon emissions by that critical year, the 
crisis of our warming planet will imperil every gain that we 
and every nation has made.  And i f we fail to secure 1.5, we 
will crush any hope of improving  out citizens’  quality of life .  
We’ve been given glimpses of  that doomsday proposition 
worldwide  in the floods, droughts, storms, wildfires, dying 
coral, and melting glaciers .Page 10 of 13 
 And, ladies and gentlemen, we in Fiji have felt that 
devastation  in the 14 cyclones that have struck us since 2014.  
These storms have stolen lives. They have levelled homes. 
They have destroyed schools. They have traumatized  our 
young.  
The Pacific’s  children  are the least to blame among the least 
to blame for the climate  crisis. Yet our children  are the most 
affected. I challenge leaders from the high -emitting nations 
to name a greater global injustice than the price that young 
Pacific Islanders pay for climate change.   
Since 2014, Fiji has rebuilt or repaired over 200  cyclone -
devasted schools. We have built cement and nature -based  
seawalls to keep out the rising seas. We have stabilized vast 
stretches of river bank. Where seawalls cannot suffice, we 
have relocated six communities –– with over 40 more in the 
queue to be moved. We are building back better to the 
standards demanded by a warmer world . We are borrowing  
hundreds of millions of dollars to do this.Page 11 of 13 
 The archaic  architecture  of multilateral development banks 
and global financial services give us little  to no  access to grant 
or concessional climate financing , particularly  for 
adaptation . Therefore, we are left with little to no choice.  
We have legislated a net -zero commitment by 2050 through 
a Climate Change Ac t that  will make us more energy secure , 
protect us from energy price shocks beyond our control , and 
provide us with cleaner air, better health and better jobs.  
Yet despite the clear benefits, the  imperative before us , and 
all the talk we hear of saving the planet –– the world’s 
collective commi tments remain  trifling. They simply will not 
keep us at well below the  two-degree Celsius target, let 
alone 1.5 degrees.  
And I again urge developed nations to deliver on the 100 -
billion -dollar climate finance commitment at COP27 in 
Egypt this year. This is now three years overdue.Page 12 of 13 
 Ahead of Glasgow, I told leaders not to bother packing their 
bags if they did not come with serious  carbon -slashing 
commitments. I have a new ask before they arrive  to Sharm 
El-Sheikh .  
 
Only come if  you plan to arrive  true to your climate finance 
commitments . Only come  to Sharm El -Sheikh if you are 
ready to agree  to a loss and damage mechanism in addition 
to a post -2025 financing framework. This must be in the 
order of $750 billion , with at least 10 percent of climate 
financ e destined for small island states.  
Excellencies,  this is our story –– a Fijian story in every sense. 
It is the story  of David against Goliath. A small state  facing 
nations, corporations, and interests far bigger than we are.   
On behalf of every family  who is watching us from home 
and praying for our success , we are unrelenting in this fight 
for your future . We are determined to provide you with 
opportunities to do well for yourselves and your families.Page 13 of 13 
 ‘We are determined to create new jobs in nature, in 
technology, in sustainable tourism , and our blue and green 
economy .  
Today w e ask the world to join us. This is not the time for 
war. This is not the time for words. This is a time for will  
and a time for courage.  
Fiji is ready to make the coming years  count for our people 
and for the planet –– our question to you  is this: A re you 
with us?   
Don’t tell us yes unless you plan to show it.  
Vinaka Vakalevu. Thank you.", FJI,2022
 NLD_77_2022,"Speech by Prime Minister Rutte  
during the  
United Nations General Assembly  
in New York 
23 September 2022  
 
Mr President,  
Your Excellencies,  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
Growing up in Europe as a child of the Cold War, the Iron Curtain was a fact 
of life.  
I still vividly remember when the first breaches began to appear in the mid-
1980s.  
The credit for that shift, which made a profound impression, was largely due 
to Mikhail Gorbachev, who passed away a few weeks ago.  
Although he represented a dogmatic, undemocratic and oppressive system, he had the courage, as a matter of principle, to choose freedom and 
humanity.  
I mention that memory here for a reason.  
As Russia’s recent past –  and Mr Gorbachev’s legacy –  have shown, we 
always have to make a choice.  
The choice between ‘might is right’ and – in the words of the great Dag 
Hammarskjöld – ‘an international community living in peace under the laws 
of justice’.  
That is my message today: working together ‘under the laws of justice’ is, 
and will remain, the only path to a safe and prosperous world.That is why Russia’s aggression must be stopped.  
And right now Russia stands on the wrong side of history.  
That is my message today: working together ‘under the laws of justice’ is, 
and will remain, the only path to a safe and prosperous world. That is why Russia’s aggression must be stopped. And right now Russia stands on the wrong side of history.  
It’s hard not to think of historical analogies, where one powerful country with expansionist ambitions invades other countries under the false pretense of victimhood and security.  
Let me be very clear: Russia is not the victim here, it is the aggressor.  
And the whole world knows it.  
No one was invading Russia. No one was threatening the Russian people.  
The people of Ukraine wanted only to be left in peace. To decide their own future.  
Again, there is only one aggressor here, and that is Russia.  
For too long, we assumed that it was pure rhetoric when Mr Putin said that 
the end of the Soviet Union was ‘the greatest geopolitical catastr ophe’.  
In hindsight, we should have paid heed to his words, because they reflect a 
dangerous worldview.  
He won’t stop at Ukraine, if we don’t stop him now This war is bigger than Ukraine itself.  
It’s about upholding the international rule of law.  
It’s abou t a sovereign people’s right to choose its own path.  
It’s about freedom.  
Theirs and ours.  
So this war is about our common future . 
And there’s only one path for us to follow, one right choice to make.  
We must uphold the fundamental principles of the UN Charter.  
Principles we agreed to after the painful lessons of history, learned from a past aggressor.  
This year, the NATO and European Union allies are more united than ever in our determination to stop Putin.  
And all UN member states should be united in conde mning this unprovokedwar.  
Because Russia’s unbridled aggression is an assault on the UN Charter and 
the international rules -based order.  
An assault on the very foundations of our partnership.  
And so an assault on the security of us all.  
The Ukrainian people are fighting for their freedom, one stride at a time.  
I have great admiration for Ukraine’s achievements on the battlefield. 
Ukraine is gaining ground. This shows that our military assistance is working. 
It motivates us to do even more.  
In the past week, Putin made a speech that can only be described as a sign 
of panic. A sign of weakness. He is losing his own ill thought war, and he 
knows it. That’s why he clutches onto his delusionary narrative, full of lies 
and deceit. His words were meant to intimidate, but they leave us cold.  
Putin’s latest threats to invoke its nuclear capabilities are intended to sow division in the growing unity that the world is showing. But he will not 
succeed.  
Together with our allies, the Netherlands will continue supporting U kraine.  
In any way we can.  
However long it takes.  
Every inch of the way.  
Together with our allies, the Netherlands will continue supporting Ukraine. In any way we can. However long it takes. Every inch of the way.  
So I call on each of you –  all the UN memb er states –  to stand firm for the 
principles we laid down in the UN Charter.  
And to stand firm until peace, freedom and territorial integrity are fully 
restored in Ukraine.  
That must be followed by rebuilding the country, and achieving justice for those wh o have suffered from the war. And the crimes and human rights 
violations arising from it.  
From sexual violence to deportation, torture and random killing.  
The horrific crimes committed in Bucha –  which I visited –  and other places, 
must not go unpunished.  
I reiterate, the empty Russian threats leave us cold. But what does not leaveus cold is the suffering of the people of Ukraine. And frankly also the 
suffering of Russian people, who are called up to fight against their will.  
Every week we’re seeing more evidence of atrocities, like in the recently liberated city of Izium. The world cannot and will not stand by and do 
nothing.  
There can be no justice without accountability.  
The Netherlands and the city of The Hague –   the legal capital of the world –  
feel a special responsibility in this regard.  
We have already supported fact -finding missions by sending forensic experts 
to Ukraine, in close cooperation with the International Criminal Court.  
And last July we hosted the Ukraine Accountability Conference,  where 45 
countries agreed on key priorities in guaranteeing justice for Ukraine.  
We know from experience that achieving international justice can be a long and painstaking process.  
For more than eight years now, we have been closing in on the Russians responsible for the downing of flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine.  
I’m grateful for the unwavering support we’ve received from Ukraine and 
many other countries in our fight for justice for the 298 victims and their 
families.  
And I promise you this: the Netherland s will continue working hard to 
ensure justice for Ukraine as well.  
 
By the same token, we stand firmly with those in Russia who oppose the 
war.  
Who long for peace and justice, who do not want to send their children into 
a senseless war, and whose voices are not being heard.  
And we will also support those people all over the world who are suffering the effects of the war indirectly.  
Putins’ war has created not only thousands of victims in Ukraine, but also hundreds of thousands –  perhaps even millions –  of victims of hunger and 
poverty around the world.  
Here too, the UN family must hold Russia to account.Putins’ cold -blooded power politics –  exploiting the most basic human needs 
of so many people – provides an extra argument for ending the fossil -fuel 
era even faster than we planned.  
It makes tackling that other great global issue –  climate change –  even more 
urgent.  
And here too, worldwide cooperation is an absolute must.  
Together we have made pledges aimed at keeping global warming below 1.5 
degrees Celsius.  
And around the world we all feel the urgency of this task.  
The Kingdom of the Netherlands –  which is made up of four very different 
countries – is also feeling the effects of climate change.   
From heavier rainfall and worsening drought in the European part of the Kingdom, to more severe hurricanes and rising sea levels in the Caribbean part.  
Small Island Developing States are at the forefront of the world’s climate -
adaptation strategies.  
And Curaçao, Aruba and St Maarten –  the island countries of our Kingdom – 
are no exception.  
We are experiencing both the challenges confronting mainland Europe and 
those which Small Island Developing States face every day: rising ocean 
temperatures, coral bleaching, loss of biodiversity and ocean pollution.  
As one Kingdom, we know that water is the factor linking all the great 
challenges of our time, from food and energy to migration and urbanisation.  
What’s more, 90 per cent of all climate disasters manifest themselves through water, via flooding, drought or pollution.  
Many parts of the world are already facing the reality of having too much or 
too little water, or water supplies that are too polluted.  
Recent events in Pakistan are a sobering reminder.  
Devastating floods, disrupting the lives of more than 30 million people . 
This illustrates once again that water is at the heart of many global 
problems.  
It has the power to turn our lives upside down.  
To threaten our health, our safety, our food, and our living environment.But at the same time, collaborating on water issues presents us with a big 
opportunity to make the world safer, healthier and more prosperous.  
Investing in water security should be a top priority for our common future.  
Because worldwide water solutions are an existential issue, making them a 
basic necessity  for the world.  
It is our responsibility to place water security at the core of all our climate 
action - and at the core of our worldwide efforts to achieve the Sustainable 
Development Goals.  
That is why the Kingdom of the Netherlands –  together with our friends 
from Tajikistan –  will be hosting next year’s UN Water Conference.  
This Conference is all about action.  
Action by governments and the private sector, working closely across 
sectors and regions.  
It can and must be a turning point.  
Because it’s now or never.  
So I urge you all to be there.  
And in the meantime we will need to step up our other climate efforts, too.  
We will have to rapidly deliver on the promises we made last year in Glasgow.  
COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh will be another milestone, if only beca use it will 
mark the first time we are convening on the African continent.  
Earlier this month I met with African leaders in Rotterdam, at the Africa 
Adaptation Summit.  
Our discussions further impressed on me the importance of climate action for Africa.  
The EU member states remain fully committed to a 55 -per-cent reduction in 
carbon emissions by 2030, and a swift transition to clean energy.  
The Netherlands is also working to combat deforestation and to help the world meet its 100 -billion- dollar pledge on climate finance.  
That money needs to go to the most vulnerable individuals and 
communities.  
To those hit hardest by climate change.  
We will continue to provide expertise and financial support to protectvulnerable areas against the elements.  
Developed countri es have a responsibility to help developing countries take 
the necessary measures.  
Only by acting together can we turn things around.  
And that’s why the Netherlands will continue pressing for a doubling of 
finance for climate adaptation.  
Half of all the money my country spends on international climate action now goes to adaptation and resilience.  
And we will continue on that path, because adaptation is in our DNA.  
To address the major issues of our time, we need each other more than ever. 
Cooperation is the  only way forward, with the UN as a vital tool. One we 
must use far more effectively.  
Your Excellencies,  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
To address the major issues of our time, we need each other more than ever.  
Cooperation is the only way forward, with the UN as a  vital tool.  
One we must use far more effectively.  
To quote Dag Hammarskjöld once more:  
The UN is what the Members make it, reflecting the weakness of all human 
effort but also the high aspirations and noble achievements of men of good will all over the wo rld. 
That is why the Netherlands supports Our Common Agenda, as a framework 
for promoting peace, security and sustainable development.  
We will continue working every day to build broad coalitions to address the major issues of our time.  
Coalitions in which water is our common bond.  
In conclusion, together we can and must defend, protect and reinforce the 
international rules -based order. Putin’s war of aggression must be stopped. 
We cannot go back to an age of imperialist wars, of mass atrocities and massgraves.  
To those still on the fence: you have a choice. Now is the time to speak out. 
Now is the time to be on the right side of history.  
Thank you.

STATEMENT  BY 
 
 
HONOURABLE  MANASSEH  DAMUKANA  SOGAVARE  
PRIME  MINISTER  OF SOLOMON  ISLANDS  
 
 
AT THE OPENING  DEBATE  OF THE SEVENTY  SEVENTH  
SESSION  OF THE UNITED  NATIONS  GENERAL  ASSEMBLY  
 
 
THEME:  “A WATERSHED  MOMENT:  TRANSFORMATIVE  
SOLUTIONS  TO INTERLOCKING  CHALLENGES ” 
 
 
23 SEPTEMBER  20221 Mr. President,   
Excellencies,  
Distinguished  delegates,  
 
Introduction  
 
Let me first convey  on behalf  of the government  and people  of 
Solomon  Islands  my warmest  greetings  to you Mr. President  and to 
the members  of this General  Assembly.  It is indeed  very humbling  to 
stand  here today  to address  this august  77th General  Assembly  as 
sovereign  equals.  
 
I take this opportunity  to congratulate  Your Excellency  Mr. 
Csaba  Kőrösi on your election  as President  of the Seventy -seventh  
Session  of the General  Assembly.  I assure  you of Solomon  Islands  
support  and cooperation  during  your tenure  in office.   
 
I also commend  and thank  your predecessor,  His Excellency  Mr. 
Abdulla  Shahid,  for his assertive  leadership  of the General  Assembly  
during  an unprecedented  period  in our history . 
 
Solomon  Islands  is a member  of the family  of Commonwealth  
count ries, and a Realm  State  so on behalf  of the government  and 
people  of Solomon  Islands,  I express  our profound  grief on the 
passing  of Her Majesty  Queen  Elizabeth  II and convey  our heartfelt2 and deepest  condolences  to His Royal  Highness,  King Charles  III, the 
Royal  Family  and the government  and people  of the United  Kingdom.  
Her Majesty  will always  be remembered  as an inspiration,  a figure  of 
stability,  dignity,  and grace.  May God bless  King Charles  III’s reign  
as Head  of the Commonwealth  and all Realm  countri es.  
 
Geopolitics,  the Pacific  Region,  and Solomon  Islands  
Mr. President,  
The shifting  international  system  has generated  renewed  strategic  
interests  in the corner  of the world  we regard  our home  - the Pacific,  
with super  and middle  powers  coming  together  seeking  to strengthen  
their presence  in the Blue Pacific  Continent.  Solomon  Islands  sees 
the global  system  as interlinked  and interdependent.   
 
The recently  adopted  2050  Strategy  of the Blue Pacific  Continent  
approved  by Pacific  Leaders  and launched  here in New York 
yesterday,  defines  the Pacific  region’s  priorities  and strategic  
interests.  The strategy  offers  opportunities  that can be leveraged  to 
benefit  our people.  The large Ocean  Island  states  that inhabit  the 
Blue Pacific  Continent  share  a common  sense  of identity  and 
purpose.  All partners  that wish to work with Pacific  countries  must  
align with this strategy.  
  
Mr President,3 The right to establish  diplomatic  relations  between  sovereign  nations  
is a universal  principle  shared  by all membe rs of the United  Nations.  
Solomon  Islands  had been unfairly  targeted  since  formalizing  
diplomatic  relations  with the People’s  Republic  of China  just over 3 
years.  We have been subjected  to a barrage  of unwarranted  and 
misplaced  criticisms,  misinformation  and intimidation  that threatens  
our democracy  and sovereignty.   
 
Solomon  Islands  has been vilified  in the media  since  formalizing  its 
relationship  with China . This decision  was reached  through  
democratic  processes  by a democratically  elected  government.  Our 
decision  to establish  relationship  with PRC is consistent  with the 
United  Nations  1971  Resolution  2758  observed  by most countries  in 
this esteemed  Assembly,  and which  also articulates  the ‘One China  
Policy’  that Solomon  Islands  respects.  I reiterate  the call for all to 
respect  our sovereignty  and democracy.   
 
Mr President,  
Solomon  Islands  has adopted  a “Friends  to all and Enemies  to None”  
Foreign  Policy.  In implementing  this policy,  we will not align 
ourselves  with any external  power(s)  or security  architecture  that 
targets  our or any other  sovereign  country  or threaten  regional  and 
international  peace.  Solomon  Islands  will not be coerced  into 
choosing  sides.4 I am reminded  of the wisdom  conveyed  by the late President  Nelson  
Mandela  during  an interview  with Ted Koppel  which  is relevant  to our 
situation,  and I quote:  
 
“One of the mistakes  which  some  political  analysts  make  is to 
think  their enemies  should  be our enemies ...Our attitude  
towards  any country  is determined  by the attitude  of that country  
to our struggle …” 
 
Solomon  Islands  has no enemies  – only friends.  Our struggle  is to 
develop  our country.  We stretch  out our hand  of friendship  and seek 
genuine  and honest  cooperation  and partnership  with all.  
 
Mutual  respect  for national  sovereignty,  territorial  integrity,  and non-
interference  into the internal  affairs  of any country  is universal  and 
paramount.  As a sovereign  nation  we embrace  and zealously  guard  
these  principles.  
 
Global  flashpoints  and conflicts  
Mr. President,  
Looking  at the wider  region,  the Taiwan  Strait  is one of the world’s  
busiest  trading  routes  used by international  shipping.  We call on all 
countries  to be sensitive  and not inflame  tensions  that can threaten  
the unity  and security  of any country.  Any miscalculation  could  
threaten  international  peace  and security  and could  have disastrous  
consequences  on global  trade.5  
On Ukraine  conflict,  Solomon  Islands  calls for maximum  restraint  by 
all parties  and a de-escalation  of the conflict.  We continue  to hear 
words  of war in this Hall of peace.  We must  be united  in our resolve  
to seek peace  and urge all parties  to pursue  a diplomatic  solution  to 
the conflict  based  on the spirit  and purpose  of our United  Nations  
Charter.   
 
Least  Development  Country  Status  
Mr. President,  
The COVID -19 pandemic,  climate  change,  impact  of global  conflicts  
and domestic  civil unrest  have jeopardized  our progress  on delivering  
against  the Sustainable  Development  Goals  and the 2030  Agenda.  It 
undermined  our ability  to graduate  out of LDC status  in 2024.  
Solomon  Islands  experienced  negative  economic  growth  due to the 
closure  of our international  borders  since  COVID -19 was declared  a 
global  pandemic  more  than two years  ago. 
 
These circumstances  have changed  the landscape  for our progress  
and sustainable  development.  We will collaborate  with partners  to 
undertake  in-depth  assessment  on our readiness  to graduate  out of 
LDC status  in 2024.  
 
Nuclear  Free Pacific  
Mr. President,6 Solomon  Islands  joins other  countries  in the Blue Pacific  Continent  
who are signatories  of the Rarotonga  Treaty  to maintain  a nuclear -
free Pacific.  We encourage  nuclear  power  states  who have signed  the 
Rarotonga  Treaty  to take the next steps  to ratify  the Treaty  which  is 
aligned  to the Treaty  on Non-Proliferation  of nuclear  weapons.  We 
reiterate  our call for the total elimination  of nuclear  material,  nuclear  
weapons,  and nuclear -powered  military  assets  in our Blue Pacific.  
Solomon  Islands  also echoes the concerns  expressed  by other  Pacific  
countries  on the proposal  by Japan  to discharge  ALPS  treated  
nuclear  water  from the Fukushima  Daiichi  Nuclear  Power  Plant  into 
the ocean.   
  
Maritime  boundaries  and United  Nations  Convention  on the Law 
of the Sea 
Mr President,   
I am pleased  to inform  the General  Assembly  that Solomon  Islands  
has now legally  formalized  the delimitation  of all five of our maritime  
boundaries  with Australia,  Papua  New Guinea,  Vanuatu,  France,  and 
Fiji. With the completion  of all five maritime  bounda ries, our rights  
and obligations  are protected  under  UNCLOS  in perpetuity.   
 
In this connection,  the Solomon  Islands  government  supports  the 
ongoing  work  undertaken  by the United  Nations  International  Law 
Commission  on the question  of sea level rise and sovereignty.  The 
position  taken  by Solomon  Islands  is that once the signed  
instruments  are deposited  with the United  Nations,  our boundaries7 have achieved  permanent  status.  This also uphold  the principles  of 
stability,  security,  certainty,  and perpetuity  enshrined  in UNCLOS.   
 
Post conflict  and peace  building  
Mr. President,  
Solomon  Islands  is a post-conflict  country  and our work to address  
the underlying  causes  of this conflict  is still a work in progress.  Sadly,  
in November  2021  this progress  was seriously  hampered  by civil 
unrest  and rioting  that exposed  the country’s  security  and economic  
fragility.  We welcome  any assistance  in addressing  our post-conflict  
challenges.  
 
On a brighter  note,  Solomon  Islands  will, for the first time,  be hosting  
the Pacific  Games  in 2023.  This event  will strengthen  the unity  of our 
nation  and will contribute  to our nation -building  and peace  building  
processes.   
I take this opportunity  to thank  our partners  that have so far assisted  
us in our preparation  to host the games – including  the People’s  
Republic  of China  who funds  the bulk of the games’  facilities,  
Republic  of Indonesia,  Australia,  Papua  New Guinea,  and Japan.  The 
2023  Pacific  Games  infrastructure  has transformed  our capital  city 
and has opened  new opportunitie s for our youthful  population.  
  
Communication  infrastructure   
Mr. President,8 Solomon  Islands  has embarked  on a ‘digital  transformation  journey’  
to enhance  and modernize  our telecommunication  infrastructure  in 
line with Sustainable  Development  Goal (SDG)   to link its more  than 
nine hundred  habited  islands  distributed  over 1.2 million  square  
kilometers  of water .  
 
Together  with Australia  and Papua  New Guinea,  Solomon  Islands  
commissioned  its first submarine  cable  in 2019.  The geographical  
reach  of the submarine  cable  will be expanded  with the installation  
of about  approximately  170 telecommunication  towers  under  a Belt 
and Road  Initiative  that will link 80% of Solomon  Islands  and provide  
our rural  populace  much -needed  access  to reliable,  accessible,  and 
affordable  telecommunication  services.  
 
We also acknowledge  with appreciation  the ongoing  support  from our 
bilateral  and multilateral  partners  including  Australia,  China,  Japan,  
New Zealand,  South  Korea,  World  Bank,  ADB,  European  Union,  the 
Green  Climat e Fund,  and others  for supporting  our infrastructure  
projects  by building  new roads,  bridges,  airports,  wharves,  and 
hydropower  dams.  
 
Climate  Change  
 Mr. President,  
I stand  here in solidarity  with my Pacific  Island  Brothers  and Sisters  
to continue  our fight against  Climate  Change.  The onset  of extreme  
temperatures,  heat waves,  droughts,  flooding,  and sea level rise has9 increased  the vulnerability  of Pacific  countries  to the negative  
impacts  of climate  change.   
 
For least developing  countries  like Solomon  Islands,  vulnerability  is 
a key hindrance  to sustainable  development.  Currently,  indicators  to 
measure  vulnerability  are inadequate.  Solomon  Islands  therefore  
calls on all states  and partners  to support  the development  of 
Multidimensional  Vulnerability  Index, (MVI)  and looks  forward  to its 
finalization  and adoption . 
 
Pacific  Island  countries  including  Solomon  Islands  are in a constant  
mode  of recovery  from disasters.  Global  financial  mechanisms  for 
disaster  recovery  need to be established  to ensure  the econo mic 
burden  of recovery  and ‘building  back better  and stronger’  following  
rapid -onset  disasters  and climate  related  disasters  are not borne  
solely  by countries  that are in serious  need of support.  
 
Considering  these  challenges,  the Pacific  region  has declar ed a ‘state  
of climate  emergency.’  Sadly,  we are seeing  more  resources  spent  on 
wars than in combating  climate  change.  This is extremely  
unfortunate.   
 
Pacific  countries  have also established  a “Pacific  Resilience  Facility”  
- a financing  mechanism  that aims to build  resilience  and reduce  
vulnerability  of Pacific  populations  to the negative  impacts  of climate10 change.  A pledging  session  for the facility  will be held during  this 
session.  We call on all partners  to support  the Facility . 
 
Solomon  Islands  also commends  the ‘Vanuatu -led initiative  
requesting  support  from the UN to ask the International  Court  of 
Justice  to provide  an advisory  opinion  on Climate  Change  that has 
also been strongly  supported  by Pacific  Leaders.  
 
Mr President,   
 
As the world continues  to combat  climate  change,  we ask all parties  
going  into COP27,  to set more  ambitious  National  Determined  
Contribution s, that would  put our world  on a 1.5 degrees  Celsius 
pathway.  We would  also like to see a roadmap  for ease of access,  and 
timely disbursements  of the US 100 billion  adaptation  finance  by 
2025.  The discussions  on Loss and Damage  demand  a stand -alone  
agenda  and COP27  aimed  at establishing  a ‘Loss  and damage  
financing  facility’.  
 
Human  rights  
Mr. President,   
Solomon  Islands  embrac es the promotion  and respect  for human  
rights  as a fundamental  freedom  for all. We subscribe  to Resolution  
60/251  that all human  rights  are universal,  indivisible,  interrelated,  
interdependent,  and mutually  reinforcing,  and that all human  rights11 must  be treated  in a fair and equal  manner,  on the same  footing  and 
with the same  emphasis.   
 
Now, I am pleased  to inform  this Assembly  that Solomon  Islands  has 
successfully  deposited  its Instrument  of Ratification  to the Optional  
Protocol  to the Convention  on the Rights  of the Child  on the sale of 
children,  child prostitution  and child pornography .  
 
We will be submitting  the Instrument  of Ratification  to the Optional  
Protocol  to the Convention  on the Rights  of the Child  on the 
involvement  of children  in armed  conflict  within  the coming  weeks.  
 
Sanctions  on Cuba  and Referendum  on New Caledonia  
Mr. President,   
We join the international  community  in reiterating  the call for the 
lifting  of the economic  embargo  imposed  on Cuba.  We commend  
Cuba’s  resilience  and urge the United  States  of America  to take the 
initiative  and normalize  relations  between  the two close  neighbors.   
 
I also wish to convey  my deepest  appreciation  to Cuba  for the training  
of our medical  students.  More  than one hundred  Solomon  Islands  
medical  doctors  have graduated  from Cuban  medical  schools  over the 
years.12 Solomon  Islands  also closely follows  the outcome  of the third 
referendum  in New Caledonia  which  took place  in December  2021  
with an air of uncertainty.  Solomon  Islands  subscribe  to resolution  
A/AC.109/2022/L.22  and supports  the call for all relevant  parties  to 
ensure  that the next steps  for the self-determination  process  are 
transparent  and inclusive.  
 
Gratitude  
Mr. President,  
In relation  to our successful  fight against  the COVID -19 pandemic,  
we express  our heartfelt  gratitude  to our partners  including  
Australia,  China,  Japan,  New Zealand,  the United  States  of America  
and the United  Nation’s  Agencies,  World  Bank  and other  multil ateral  
agencies  who stood  with us and provided  us with tremendous  
support  and much -needed  COVID -19 vaccines  through  the COVAX  
facility  as well as bilaterally.   
 
Solomon  Islands  is also extremely  grateful  for employment  
opportunities  provided  by Australia  and New Zealand  through  their 
respective  labour  mobility  programs  to accommodate  some  of the 
unemployed  twenty  thousand  youths  who enter  our labour  market  
every  year.    
 
 Conclusion  
Mr. President,13 Let me conclude  by thanking  you again  for the theme  for this year’s  
General  Assembly  session.   
 
Our world  is at cross -roads.  It is feeling  the strain  of divisive  elements  
that can divide  us. We must  not allow  that to happen.  We have been 
weighed  down  by the COVID -19 pandemic.  We are feeling  the 
negative  impacts  of geopolitical  conflicts  and wars.  
 
The time has come  for our world  to rally and focus  on what  unites  us 
rather  than what  divides  us – for the world  will be always  stronger  if 
we are together.  
 
We must foster  friendship  and solidarity  through  genuine  and 
durable  partnerships.  We must  commit  to work  together,  with each 
other  to ensure  we can leave  behind  a legacy  of a more  peaceful,  just, 
and brighter  world  for the young  generations  that will come  after us. 
 
Mr. President,  the key questions  we must  each ask ourselves  are, (i) 
what  legacies  do we as today’s  leaders  leave  behind  for those  that will 
come  after us, and (ii), how do we wish to be remembered  by 
generations  that will follow?  
 
I am sure we would all wish to be remembered  as the generation  of 
leaders  that uplifted  our world,  that united  our people  and our 
countries  to live together  in peaceful  co-existence.14  
Mr. President  and fellow  leaders,  if we can leave  a legacy  that 
safeguards  the survival  and freedom  of our future  generations,  we 
will have done our jobs well. 
 
To God be the Glory  great  things  He has done.  Thank  you.", SLB,2022

CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY 
 
E ngā Mana, e ngā Reo, Rau Rangatira mā kua huihui mai 
nei i tēnei Whare Nui o te Ao  
  
Ngā mihi maioha ki a koutou katoa, mai i tōku  Whenua o 
Aotearoa  
  
Tuia ki runga, Tuia ki raro, ka Rongo to pō ka rongo te ao  
 
Nō reira, tēnā koutou katoa  
  
 
Mr President,  
Mr Secretary -General,  
Friends,  
  
I greet you in te reo Māori, the language of the tangata whenua, 
or first people, of Aotearoa New  Zealand.  
 
I acknowledge the leaders who are here, gathered in person after 
a long and difficult period .  
 
And as is tradition, in my country, I also acknowledge those who 
have passed .  
 
Loss brings with it a chance for reflection.   
 
And as leaders, between us we each represent countries and 
communities who have lost much in these past few 
years.  Through famine, severe weather, natural disasters and a 
pandemic. 
 
COVID -19 was devastating. It took millions of lives. It continues 
to impact on our economi es and with that, the wellbeing of our 
people. It set us back in our fight against the crisis of climate 
change and progress on the Sustainable Development Goals 
while we looked to the health crisis in front of us.   
 
And while we enter a period now where t he crisis is subsiding, 
the lessons cannot.   
 
COVID schooled us.   
 
It forced us to acknowledge how interconnected, and therefore 
how reliant we are on one another.   
 
We move between one another’s countries with increasing ease. 
We trade our goods and servi ces. And when one link in our supply 
chain is impacted, we all are.   
 
The lessons of COVID, are in many ways the same as the lessons 
of climate change.   
 
When crisis is upon us, we cannot and will not solve these issues 
on our own.   
 
The next pandemic will  not be prevented by one country’s efforts, 
but by all of ours. Climate action will only ever be as successful 
as the least committed country, as they pull down the ambition 
of the collective. 
 
I am not suggesting though that we rely on the good will of o thers 
to make progress. We need a dual strategy. One where we push 
for collective effort, but we also use our multilateral tools to make 
progress.   
 
That’s why on pandemic preparedness we support efforts to 
develop a new global health legal instrument, str engthened 
international health regulations and a strong and empowered 
World Health Organisation.   
 
It’s why we are such advocates of the World Trade Organisation 
and its reform to ensure supply chains remain open and critical 
goods and services are not subjected to protectionism in times 
of need.   
 
It’s why we have worked so hard within the Paris Agreement to 
see the action we need on climate , while also doing our  bit at 
home  including putting a 1.5 degree warming limit into law, 
increasing our NDC to 50 % below 2005 levels by 2030, and 
quadrupling  our climate finance commitment.  
 
Whether it’s climate, trade, health crisis or seeking peaceful 
solutions to war and conflict - New Zealand has always been a 
believer in multilateral tools. 
 
We were amongst the founding members of the United Nations 
as governments of the day recognised that the perils of war 
would only be avoided through a greater sense of shared 
responsibility.   
 
The basis on which this institution was formed, remains as 
relevant today as it  was then.   
 
But without reform, we risk irrelevancy.   
 
There is perhaps no greater example of this than Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine.  Let us all be clear Russia’s war is illegal.  
 
It is immoral.  
 
It is a direct attack on the UN Charter and the internat ional rules -
based system  and everything that this community should stand 
for.  
 
Putin’s suggestion that it could at any point deploy further 
weapons that it has at their disposal reveals the false narrative 
that they have based their invasion on. What coun try who claims 
to be a l iberator, threatens to annihilate  the very ci vilians they 
claim to liberate?  
 
This war is based on a lie. 
 
But I recognise, that for the people of Ukraine who have lost 
loved ones, their sense of peace and security, their livelihoo ds - 
these are all just words. They need us, as a global community to 
ask one simple question.   
 
What if it was us?  
 
Our ability to answer that question with any confidence  that we 
have the tools as a global community to act swiftly and 
collectively  has been severely undermined.  
 
In March when we most needed the UN Security Council to act in 
the defence of international peace and security, it could not. It 
did not fulfil its mandate because of one permanent member who 
was willing to  abuse its privile ged position.   
 
That was wrong.  
 
We will not give up on the ability of our multilateral institutions 
to stand up against this illegal war , or to take on the many 
challenges we face .   
 
These institutions are the ballast we need, but it’s a ballast that 
requires modernisation, fit for the tumultuous waters we all face . 
 
 
That is why New  Zealand was pleased to champion the Veto 
Initiative . Not only does it provide an opportunity to scrutinise 
the actions of the permanent member who cast a veto, the Veto 
Initiative gives the whole UN membership a voice where the 
Security Council has been unable to act.    
 
But we continue to call for more than that.  
 
For th e United Nations to maintain its relevancy, and ensure that 
it truly is the voice of the breadth of co untries it represents, the 
veto must be abolished and Permanent Members must exercise 
their responsibility for the benefit of international peace and 
security, rather than the pursuit of national interest.  
 
There are other battles that we continue to wage as a nation , 
including our call for a global response to  the use of nuclear 
weapons.   
 
Our history of championing not just non -proliferation, but a 
prohibition on nuclear weapons is grounded in what we have 
witnessed, but also what we have experienced.  
 
We are a nation that is both of the Pacific, and within it. It was 
in our region that these weapons of war were tested. Those tests 
have left a mark on the people, lands and waters of our home. 
 
The only way to guarantee our people that they will be safe fr om 
the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons, 
is for them not to exist.   
 
That’s why Aotearoa New Zealand calls on all states that share 
this conviction to join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear 
Weapons.  
 
Some will call such a position naive.  
 
Some believe that we are safer as a result of nuclear weapons. 
In New  Zealand, we have never accepted the wisdom of mutually 
assured destruction.  
 
It takes one country to believe that their cause i s nobler, their 
might stronger, their people more willing to be sacrificed. None 
of us can stand on this platform and turn a blind eye to the fact 
that there are already leaders amongst us who believe this.   
 
Nuclear weapons do not make us safer.  
 
There will be those who agree but believe it is simply too hard to 
rid ourselves of nuclear weapons at this juncture. There is no 
question that nuclear disarmament is an enormous challenge. 
But if given the choice, and we are being given a choice, surely 
we would choose the challenge of disarmament than the 
consequences  of a failed strategy of weapons -based deterrence . 
 
And this is why we will continue to advocate for meaningful 
progress on the Nuclear Non -Proliferation Treaty. Progress and 
consensus that was recently blocked by Russia - and represented 
a backwards step to the efforts of nearly every country in the 
world to make some even limited progress on nuclear 
disarmament and non -proliferation.   
 
None of this will stop New Zealand’s advocacy.  
 
We wil l remain a strong and passionate advocate for efforts to 
address the weapons of old, but also, the weapons that are new.   
 
After all, the face of war has changed.   
  
And with that, the weapons used.  
 
The tools used to challenge the statehood of others are hidden 
and more complex.   
 
Traditional combat, espionage, and the threat of nuclear 
weapons are now accompanied by cyber -attacks, prolific 
disinformation, and manipulation of whole communities and 
societies.   
 
As leaders, we have never treated the weapons of old in the same 
way as those that have emerged. And that’s understandable. 
After all, a bullet takes a life. A bomb takes out a whole village. 
 
A lie online or from a podium does not.   
 
But what if that lie, told repeatedly, and across many platforms, 
prompts, inspires, or motivates others to take up arms. To 
threaten the security of others. To turn a blind eye to atrocities, 
or worse, to become complicit in them. What then?  
 
This is no longer a hypothetical. The weapons of war have 
changed, they are up on us and require the same level of action 
and activity that we put into the weapons of old.   
 
We recognise d the threats that the old weapons created. We 
came together as communities to minimise these threats. We 
created international rules, norms and expe ctations. We never 
saw that as a threat to our individual liberties - rather, it was a 
preservation of them.   
 
The same must apply now as we take on these new challenges . 
 
In New Zealand, we deeply value our right to protest. Some of 
our major social progre ss has been brought ab out by hikoi or 
people power  - becoming the first country in the world to 
recognise women ’s right to vote, movement on major indigenous 
and human rights issues to name but a few . 
 
Upholding these values in a modern environment tran slates into 
protecting a free , secure  and open internet. To realise all of the 
opportunities that it presents in the way we communicate, 
organise and gather.   
 
But that does not mean the absence of transparency,  
expectations or even rules.   If we correctly  identify what it is we 
are trying to prevent.   
 
And surely we can start with violent extremism and terrorist 
content online.   
 
On the 15th of March 2019 New Zealand experienced a horrific 
terrorist attack on its Muslim community. More than 50 people 
were killed as they prayed. The attack was live -streamed on a 
popular social media platform in an effort to gain notoriety, and 
to spread hate.   
 
At that time, the ability to thwart those goals was limited. And 
the chances of government alone being able to reso lve this gap 
was equally challenging. That’s why, alongside President 
Emmanuel Macron we created the Christchurch Call to Action.  
  
The Call Community has worked together to address terrorism 
and violent extremist content online. As this important work 
progresses, we have demonstrated the impact we can have by 
working together collaboratively. 
 
We’ve improved crisis reactions , stymieing the ability to live 
stream attacks , we have crisis protocols that kick in to prevent 
proliferation.   
 
We are also focused on prevention – understanding the 
interactions between online environment and the real world that 
can lead to radicalisation.   
 
This week we launched an initiative alongside  companies and 
non-profits to help improve research and understanding of how 
a person ’s online experiences are curated  by automated 
processes . 
  
This will also be important in understanding more about mis and 
disinformation online. A challenge that we must  as leaders 
address.   
 
Sadly, I think it’s easy to dismiss this problem as one in the 
margins. I can certainly understand the desire to leave it to 
someone else. As leaders, we are rightly concerned that even 
those most light -touch approaches to disinforma tion could be 
misinterpreted as being hostile to the values of free speech we 
value so highly.   
 
But while I cannot tell you today what the answer is to this 
challenge, I can say with complete certainty that we cannot 
ignore it . To do so poses an equal thr eat to the norms we all 
value. 
 
 
After-all, how do you successfully end a war if people are led to 
believe the reason for its existence is not only legal but noble ?  
 
How do you tackle climate change if people do not believe it 
exists?  
 
How do you ensure t he human rights of others are upheld, when 
they are subjected to hateful and dangerous rhetoric and 
ideology?  
 
The weapons may be different, but the goals of those who 
perpetuate them is often the same. To cause chaos and reduce 
the ability of others to de fend themselves. To disband 
communities. To collapse the collective strength of countries who 
work together.  
  
But we have an opportunity here to ensure that these particular 
weapons of war do not become an established part of warfare.   
 
And so, we once ag ain come back to the primary tool we have. 
Diplomacy, dialogue, working together on solutions that do not 
undermine human rights, but enhance them.  
 
For those who have not sought out the Christchurch Call to 
Action, I ask that you consider it. As with so m any of the 
challenges we face, we will only be as strong as those who do 
the least. 
 
In these times, I am acutely aware of how easy it is to feel 
disheartened. We are facing many battles on many fronts.   
 
But there is cause for optimism.   
 
Because for every new weapon we face, there is a new tool to 
overcome it.   
 
For every attempt to push the world into chaos, is a collective 
conviction to bring us back to order.   
 
We have the means; we just need the collective will.

STATEMENT BY  
 
 
Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo HUN SEN  
Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia  
 
 
At 
The General Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations  
General Assembly   
 
 
 
New York, September 23, 2022 | P a g e  - Excellency Csaba Kőrösi , President of the General Assembly;  
- Excellency António Guterres , UN Secretary -General;  
- Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen!  
At the outset, I would like to congratulate H.E. Csaba Kőrösi  on his 
election as President of the 77th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) 
Session. At the same time, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to 
H.E. Abdulla Shahid  for his efforts in leading the work of the 76th UNGA 
Session during a very tumultuous time.  
Our theme of the 77th UNGA Session : “A watershed moment: 
transformative solutions to interlocking challenges ”, is indeed relevant to 
the current context. Global uncertainties have been exacerbated by the 
escalation of armed conflicts, arms race, the rise of mini security alliances, 
the technology and trade wars, the imposition of economic sanctions, and 
the moun ting threats to multilateralism.  
In fact, the war in Ukraine has complicated not just international 
relations in Europe but caused serious economic disruptions and 
exacerbated our food and energy security . The escalation of the hostilities 
involving more and more actors, directly or indirectly, and with no end in 
sight, coupled with the threat of a  nuclear war have  serious impacts on the 
world at large.  
The situation in the Korean Peninsula remains alarming due to 
preparation for  a seventh nuclear test. T his year, North Korea has launched 
dozens of ballistic missiles in response to military drills . In addition, the U.S. -
China tension over the Taiwan issue has also posed a concern.  
Overall, in this very challenging environment, as a country that has 
experie nced a hard -earned peace in our own history, Cambodia is making 
great efforts to engage constructively with the United Nations in upholding 
international peace and security as well as promoting respect for the 
fundamental principles and values of the UN Ch arter and international 
laws. | P a g e  - Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen!  
 
The present gathering reflects remarkable success of our collective 
efforts to overcome the unprecedented pandemic, yet the battle against this 
global  health crisis is not over yet.  
New forms of variants and other infectious diseases are emerging. 
What else could com e out in the future? A strong global health system, 
particularly the World Health Organization (WHO) with its central 
coordination role could assist in building up a resilient and sustainable 
national health system. An open and transparent multilateral eng agement in 
the distribution of vaccines, driven by a true principle of shared 
responsibility, is the only way to prepare for and prevent future pandemics, 
coupled with the sharing of lessons learned and best practices, the transfer 
of technologies in vacci ne research and development.  
Besides that , the existential threat facing humankind is also our 
vulnerability to climate change. We need to change the process of addressing 
the climate change issues today, not tomorrow. It has been 50 years already 
since g overnments were warned about changing  our production and 
consumption patterns to avoid disaster. Sadly, ever since, we only see more 
losses of biodiversity, more land degradation, and a growing scarcity of 
fresh water.  
Our collective action must focus on global mitigation efforts to 
promote climate -resilient development. Our commitment to lowering the 
global temperature by 1.5 deg rees Celsius  requires dedicated climate 
financing and technology transfer to facilitate meaningful transition in 
mitigation and adaptation efforts. The Glasgow outcomes adopted at the 
COP26 must be implemented with great urgency bearing in mind the 
princip le of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective 
capabilities. | P a g e  Moreover,  the threat of the trade and economic decoupling arising 
from the U.S.-China rivalry will certainly dampen the prospects for global 
growth. Therefore, the fundamental t ransformative solution of the social, 
economic and political process  is to strengthen the rules -based multilateral 
trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its heart that 
can promote an open international trade, reduce trade barriers, and ensure 
the resilience of regional and global value chains.  
Meanwhile , we need to pay greater attention on inclusive digital 
policies and conducive  regulatory frameworks that lead to greater 
investment in digital infrastructure, as it is so essential in bridging the  
growing digital divides and generating  new sources of growth.  Enhancing 
green economic development is also an indispensable part of nurturing 
sustainable socio -economic development, through the expansion of 
cooperation in building green infrastructure, promoting energy transition, 
and leverag ing green technology.  
- Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen!  
This  year,  Cambodia is honored to hold the Chairmanship of ASEAN. 
So far, this organization is 55 -year -old; and we are proud to celebrate our 
historic milestone and the remarkable achievements we have made along 
the way . Throughout the years, ASEAN has been able to navigate through 
the constantly changing geopolitical landscape to emerge as one of the most 
prominent and successful regional organization, while making great strides 
in advancing its c redibility and relevance in world affairs.  
Our theme  “ASEAN A.C.T.: Addressing Challenges Together,”  
highlighting the  strong spirit of togetherness,  encompasses all the  key 
pressing issues I have mentioned earlier. Of course, these challenges  do have  
far-reaching implications on the ASEAN Community building process and 
our external relations. But as  the Chair of ASEAN, Cambodia is committed 
as ever  to consolidate our efforts to address our s hared goals of bringing 
benefits to our peoples based on the spirit of ASEAN Centrality, Unity, and 
Solidarity. | P a g e  Indeed , the situation in Myanmar is worrisome with its direct 
implications on the security and stability of the whole region;  but we must 
recogn ize that the crisis is complex with deep -rooted causes. As the ASEAN 
Chair, Cambodia is fully committed to helping Myanmar resolve the crisis 
and all our efforts are aimed at seeking for the cessation of violence, the 
delivery of humanitarian assistance to  those in need, and the pursuit of 
building trust among all parties concerned to enable an inclusive political 
dialogue, as mandated by the ASEAN 5 -Point Consensus.  
- Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen!  
Over the past two years, the Royal Government of Cambodia’s (RGC) 
has made great efforts in a pro -active manner to prevent the spread of Covid -
19 virus through the introduction of health measures, social and economic 
interventions and administrative measur es. The RGC has set COVID -19 
vaccination as a Key Strategic Measure .  
As a result, Cambodia has become one of the countries with the highest 
coverage rate of vaccinated population globally, particularly, achieving 
strong "" Herd Immunity "" and enabling the co untry to fully re -open in late 
2021 as well as resuming all socio -economic activities in the new normal. 
Taking this opportunity, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to 
all our friendly countries who have provided vaccines to Cambodia through 
both bilateral and multilateral frameworks.  
On social sector, the RGC has worked with development partners such 
as the UN agencies to launch and scale up a number of important programs 
such as 1). Cash for Work Program aimed at improving community 
infrastru cture and providing additional employment opportunities and 2). 
Cash Transfer Program for the poor and vulnerable households to help 
alleviate hardship and maintain the livelihood of the poor.  
On economic sector, the RGC has made unremitting efforts to add ress 
chronic structural problems, competitiveness and promote economic 
diversification. In fact, the RGC has addressed major challenges faced by | P a g e  businesses through the implementation of the New Investment Law , 
Cambodia Digital Economy and Society Policy Fr amework 2021 -2035 , 
Strategic Framework and Programs for Economic Recovery in the Context 
of Living with Covid -19 in a New Normal 2021 -2023 , Law on Public -
Private Partnership and adoption of  free trade agreements such as 
Cambodia -China FTA and Cambodia -Repu blic of Korea FTA  and 
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Overall, 
Cambodian economy is estimated to achieve a growth rate of 5.4% by 2022, 
supported by a strong recovery in manufacturing, tourism and agriculture.  
 In terms  of democratizati on process, the recent  commune election held 
last June has reflected our continued efforts as more than 80% of registered 
voters went to cast their ballots in a free, fair, peaceful, and transparent 
manner. The appreciation and full support of Cambodian people for the 
unremittin g efforts of RGC in preserving peace, political stability, socio -
economic development, and the successful fight against the Covid -19 
pandemic resulted in an overwhelming majority vote in favor of the ruling 
party.   
Furthermore, on peacekeeping mission,  Cambodia has continued 
deploying thousands of her peacekeeping forces to undertake missions in 
countries in crisis. More than 15% of Cambodian peacekeepers serving in 
UN missions are “women” . They are the role models, inspiring women and 
girls in often male -dominated societies to perform their rights and 
participate in the peace process.  
On the cooperation with the United Nations, I wish to note that j ust 
yesterday, the Supreme Court Chambers of the Extraordinary Chambers in 
the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) issued its judgment to uphold the life 
sentence of former Khmer Rouge head of state for genocide, crimes against 
humanity, and grave breaches of the Ge neva Conventions. This historical 
moment highlighted the great cooperation between Cambodia and the 
United Nations through the hybrid court in bringing justice to the people of 
Cambodia who had suffered the heinous crime of auto -genocide. We could | P a g e  tell the  world of the truth that is found and justice that is served, and 
propagate to the world that this crime should never happen again in human 
history. I take this moment to express appreciation to all donors for 
providing supporting budget and to our Cambodi an compatriots for their 
cooperation in consolidating national reconciliation process.  
In conclusion, Mr. President , despite  many challenges impact ing our 
political,  social, and economic progress, we remain as committed as always 
to attaining the 2030 Agen da for Sustainable Development goals.  
 
Thank You!", KHM,2022

STATEMENT  BY 
THE  HONOURABLE  PHILIP  J. PIERRE  
PRIME  MINISTER  OF SAINT  LUCIA   
AND  
MINISTER  FOR  FINANCE,  ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT  AND  THE  YOUTH  ECONOMY  
 
TO THE  GENERAL  DEBATE  OF THE   
77th SESSION  OF THE  UNITED  NATIONS  GENERAL  ASSEMBLY  
 
NEW  YORK  
FRIDAY,  23rd   SEPTEMBER,  2022  
 
Please  check  against  delivery.Mr. President,  Distinguished  Heads  of State  and Government,  Other  Distinguished  Heads  of 
Delegations  and Delegates,  cherished  citizens  of our distressed  planet,  I bring  you greetings  from  
Saint  Lucia.    
 
Let me join in the congratulations  to you Mr. Presid ent on your election  to lead this august  body  and 
assure  you of Saint  Lucia’s  support  as you preside  over our deliberations  at one of the most  critical  
moments  in the history  of this Organisation.  
 
Mr. President,  I address  this distinguished  body  with the democratic  permission  of the people  of 
Saint  Lucia,  a small  but proud  state in the Eastern  Caribbean.   We insist,  Mr. President,  that our 
history  and present  circumstances,  place  upon  us the responsibility  of serving  as voices  of 
redemption  and hope  at times of crisis.     
 
Mr. President,  I agree  with the theme  under  which  this 77th Session  of the General  Assembly  is 
being  conducted  – “A Watershed  Moment:  Transformative  Solutions  to Interlocking  challenges.”  
 
Because,  given  the morbid  developments  in the contemporary  global  political  environment  it is 
reasonable  to conclude  that we deviated,  to our detriment,  from  the course  that the framers  of the 
UN Charter  had set for us. It is for this reason  that we have arrived  at a watershed  moment  in 
history.   
 
Mr. President  we have arrived  at this watershed  moment  in history  because,  we, the members  of the 
United  Nations  have not adhered  to the rules  and principles  of the Organisation  that we created  76 
years  ago, as a multilateral  answer  to mankind’s  propensity  to use arms  against  his fellow  man,  
instead  of joining  with him to turn them  into tools  for peace  and development.We have  arrived  at this watershed  moment,  because,  we have  failed  to adhere  to the agreements  we 
have  negotiated  multilaterally  to solve  the problems  that have confronted  us – problems  invariably  
of our own making.    
 
We have  come  to this watershed  moment,  because  small  developing  countries  continue  to suffer  
from  an inequitable  world  order,  in which  the rich and powerful  do not right  the wrongs  they 
commit  against  the weak.  
 
A World  Stacked  Against  us, Frustrating  Our Development  
Mr. President,  despite  our small  size, despite  our deliberate  desire  to be a source  of peace  and 
friendship  to all, despite  our democratic  traditions,  and despite  our earnest  efforts  to make  the 
development  of our people  our primary  objective,  we find ourselves  in a world  stacked  against  us 
and frustrating  our development  at every  turn.   
 
Sadly,  Mr. President,  a survey  of the global  political -economy  of the last four decades  reads  like a 
cascading  series  of crises,  and a frustrating  tale of arrested  develo pment  and dashed  hopes  for the 
people  of the Caribbean.   
 
In every  decade  since  1980,  we have  faced  the ill-winds  of a harsh  and global  environment,  to 
which  we are forced  to change  course  without  reward,  and with little to show  for our efforts.  
In the 1990s, it was the entry  of the United  Kingdom  into the European  Single  Economy  which  
removed  any lingering  protections  from  which  we benefited  and which  placed  us at greater  
exposure  to a world  of liberalized  trade,  with no consideration  for our specific  historical  
circumstances.  
 
Then  came  the decade  of the 2000s,  in which  the WTO  was formalized  and with which  came  an 
even  harsher  reality  of trade  liberalization  that has not lived  up to its promise  of cheaper  goods  and 
services  for all.   
 
Instead,  we have  mostly  witnessed  declines  in the demand  for our primary  commodities  like 
bananas,  sugar  and rum.  If anything,  the new rules  of trade  have  taught  us harsh  lessons  on howglobal  institutional  arrangements  are designed  to punish  us when  we are accused  of wrong,  but fail 
to reward  and protect  us when  we are wronged.    
The experience  of Antigua  and Barbuda  is instructive  in this regard.   
 
In the year 2001,  we witnessed  the terrorist  attack  on the United  States  of America  which  brought  
with it another  round  of negative  economic  circumst ances.  9/11 was followed  by the global  
financial  crisis  of 2008  - a crisis  not of our own making  - but one for which  we in the Caribbean  
were  amongst  the hardest  hit.  Our tourism  industries  suffered  tremendously  as the financial  losses  
in the main  source  markets  resulted  in a reduction  of tourism  traffic  to our countries.    
 
This tale of frustrated  development  continued  in 2016  with BREXIT  and was worsened  by the 
COVID -19 Pandemic.  Presently,  the ongoing  conflict  between  Russia  and Ukraine  has brought  with 
it unseen  hikes  and uncertainty  in the price  of oil and has wiped  out all of our hopes  for a smooth  
recovery  from  the COVID -19 pandemic.  
 
In addition,  twenty  years  after the first conference  on Financing  for Development  in 2002,  the 
mechanisms  and global  frameworks  we established  through  the United  Nations  Financing  for 
Development  process,  tell a damning  tale of gaps and short  falls,  commitments  not kept,  systematic  
barriers  reinforced,  and negative  challenges.   
Had our partners  lived  up to their commitme nts, our current  circumstances  of economic  distress  
may not have  been  as dire. 
Our diversification  into financial  services  is also threatened  by an uneven  regime  of negative  
regulations.  And,  overarching  all of this, are the continued  challenges  of climate  change  with its 
fierce  occurrences  of floods,  droughts  and hurricanes,  adding  yet more  uncertainty  to our economic  
projections  and aspirations.  
 
 
 
 
 
Climate  ChangeMr. President,  it is no longer  breaking  news  or a matter  of debate  that climate  change  is one of the 
biggest  crises  facing  mankind  today.   
But the solutions  to the universal  climate  change  emergency  are not mystifying.  From  the 2015  
Paris  Agreement,  where  we agreed  that limit ing global  warming  to below  1.5° C would  help us stay 
alive,  to COP  26 in Glasgow,  we have  followed  the science,  negotiated,  compromised  and agreed  
upon  the solutions.   
The problem  is that these  agreements  have  been broken  or simply  ignored.   Those  who are the 
biggest  perpetrators  of the climate  crisis  and who were  supposed  to take the corresponding  greatest  
action,  have  not followed  through  on their commitments.   
The quantum  of financing  for climate  justice,  needed  by Developing  Countries  and agreed  upon  by 
the Developed  countries,  has not materialized.  Other  issues  of the Paris  rule book  are still to be 
implemented.   
The Multilateral  development  financial  institutions  have yet to change  their systems  to make  it 
easier  for developing  countries  to access  the financing  required  to adapt  to climate  change  and build  
climate  resilient  economies.  
Mr. President,  Developing  countries;  already  saddled  with debt,  must  be given  the means  to be able 
to deal with climate  change.  We must  act together  to save our people  and our planet.  It is 
regrettable,  therefore,  that recent  political  differences  between  two of the biggest  polluting  
countries,  have  led to a halting  of cooperation  between  them  on climate  issues.   
The future  of our planet  must  never  be held hostage  to the politics  of superpower  rivalry.  
Mr. President,  I want  to take this opportunity  to congratulate  the Government  and people  of 
Grenada  on the appointment  of its former  Environment  Minister  Simon  Stiel,  as the Executive  
Secretary  of the UN Framework  Convention  on Climate  Change,  (UNFCC).   The appointment  of 
someone  from  a small  island  state is hopefully  a signal  that the world  is listening  to the pleas  of the 
most  vulnerable,  for positive  and urgent  action  in this climate  crisis.  We urge the Developed  World  
to act upon  the solutions  to climate  change  that they have  agreed  upon.  
A special  regime  for small  island  developing  statesFor decades  Mr. President,  we have called  on global  financial  institutions  to carve  out a special  
regime  that takes  into account  our smallness  and our vulnerabilities  to climate  change.   This is not 
an unreasonable  demand.   We have insisted  that many  of the challenges  that we face have  come  
from  the external  environment  and are not of our own making.    
Given  our small  size and our miniscule  levels  of industrial  pollution,  we are among  the least 
responsible  for global  warming,  but given  our small  size and our vulnerable  economies  we are 
among  the most  defenseless  to the ravages  of climate  change.  A single  hurricane,  which  destroys  
our entire  agricultural  crop or destroys  our tourism  plant  and infrastructure,  can set us back  by 
decades.    
We are simply  asking  that these  vulnerabilities  be considered  when  our financial  obligations  for 
development  assistance  are being  negotiated.   This will result  in the mutually  beneficial  solution  of 
ensuring  that the wheels  of the global  economy  keep  on turning,  while  at the same time allowing  us 
the breathing  space  to participate  meaningfully,  with a renewed  sense  of faith in the legitimacy  of 
the global  financial  system  and its institutions.   
For three  decades,  from  the Adoption  of Agenda  21, through  to several  General  Assemb ly 
resolutions  and the SAMOA  Pathway,  there  have been  calls for the adoption  of a Multidimensional  
Vulnerability  Index  (MVI)  for SIDS.   
The MVI  will replace  the unreliable  and unfair  Gross  National  Income  index  that precludes  SIDS  
from  accessing  badly  need ed low cost and concessional  financing  for their development.  The work  
on the MVI  by the UN and other  institutions  like the Caribbean  Development  Bank  must  now be 
accelerated  and finalized.  
A reform  of the regime  can no longer  be ideological  or political.  We need  to include  the 
vulnerabilities  of small  states  like Saint  Lucia  when  calculating  the value  of their economies.   This 
is a matter  of survival  for our people.  
 
 
Ocean  GovernanceMr. President,  we are disappointed  that in another  area of vital import ance to Small  Island  
Developing  States  - Ocean  Governance  - negotiations  to adopt  the first ever multilateral  maritime  
biodiversity  treaty,  stalled  in August,  because  the developed  countries  of the North  were  once  again  
unwilling  to accommodate  the needs  of the developing  world  of the South.    
Protecting  the oceans  is an imperative;  and agreement  on the sharing  and sustainable  use of the 
marine  resources  that are beyond  national  jurisdiction  is essential.  Bearing  in mind,  that these  areas  
do not belong  to one country  but are the heritage  of all mankind,  Saint  Lucia  therefore  calls for the 
urgent  resumption  of the Fifth  Session  of the Inter -Governmental  Conference  on the treaty,  so that 
its text can be finalized,  taking  into account  the special  circumstances  of small  island  developing  
states.   
Global  Conflicts   
Articles  2 and 33 of the UN Charter  are unambiguous  in binding  Member  States  to refrain  from  the 
threat  or use of force  against  the territorial  integrity  or political  independence  of any state and to 
negotiate  and settle  all international  disputes  by peace ful means.   
In the Declaration  on the Commemoration  of the 75th Anniversary  of the UN, Heads  of State  and 
Government  reaffirmed  those  principles,  when  they said: “We will promote  peace  and prevent  
conflict.  We will abide  by international  law and ensure  justice.”  
Mr. President,  the war in Ukraine,  has not only unleashed  death  and horrendous  destruction,  but has 
plunged  the world  into an economic  crisis  of runaway  inflation,  catastrophic  shortages  of food and 
energy  supplies  and worsened  a global  supply  chain  crisis  that had been  triggered  by the COVID19  
pandemic.   
The world  could  have been  spared  this humanitarian  and economic  agony,  if once  again  countries  
and their leaders  had respected  and adhered  to the principles  of the Charter  of the United  Nations.   
We therefore  call upon  all parties  involved  to immediately  end the conflict  in Ukraine,  by 
undertaking  immediate  negotiations  to permanently  settle  all disputes  in accordance  with the 
principles  of the United  Nations.   
The billions  and billions  of dollars  being spent  in Ukraine  in wanton  destruction  and war could  have  
transformed  for the better,  the economies,  the livelihoods  and the lives  of millions  and millions  ofpeople  in the developing  countries  of the world,  if spent  on poverty  reduction  and economic  
transformation.  
It is from  this perspective,  Mr. President,  that Saint  Lucia  also laments  the recent  escalation  of 
military  tensions  in the Taiwan  Straits  that threatened  regional  and international  peace  and security;  
and so Saint  Lucia  calls upon  those  responsible  to observe  the UN rules  on peaceful  settlement  of 
disputes  and respect  for the territorial  integrity  and political  independence  of all countries.   
The people  of Taiwan  have  freely  determined  their political  status  and ought  to be allowed  to 
contin ue their chosen  path to economic,  social  and cultural  development  and to confirm  their right  
to self-determination.  Saint  Lucia  calls for the meaningful  participation  of Taiwan  in the organs  and 
agencies  of the United  Nations.   
Situation  in Cuba,  Venezuela , Haiti  
Further,  in the interest  of peace  and stability  in the contemporary  global  political  environment,  we 
continue  to call for the reduction  of tension  and the normalization  of relations  with our regional  
neighbours  of Venezuela  and Cuba.    
And in this regard,  Mr. President,  in keeping  with the Charter  of the United  Nations  on a people’s  
right  to self-determination  and political  independence,  we once  again  call for the immediate  
removal  of the inhumane  economic  embargo  against  Cuba.  
Given  the devast ating  impacts  of the sanctions  on the Venezuelan   people,   coupled  with Covid  19 
pandemic,  and compounded  by the expanding  crisis  of the world  economy  arising  out of the war in 
Ukraine,  let us also use this moment  as a watershed  for lifting  the painful  sanctions  against  the 
people  of Venezuela.   Let us work  towards  opening  up a new period  of prosperity  for Latin  America  
and the Caribbean.   
In that vein,  Saint  Lucia  wishes  to register  its grave  concern  over the continuing  deterioration  of the 
security  situation  and social  circumstances  in the Republic  of Haiti.  We will continue  to engage  
with the rest of the CARICOM  family,  and the global  community  to facilitate  a process  towards  
normalization  and ultimately  the holding  of free and fair and credible  elections.  
Illegal  Arms  
Mr.  President ,While  Saint  Lucia  and the rest of the Caribbean  are not manufacturers  of conventional  weapons,  our 
countries  have  been  plagued  by a proliferation  of illegal  small  arms  and light weapons,  resulting  in 
a surge  in criminal  activity  and gun violence.  
Saint  Lucia  has always  been  a strong  advocate  of the international  frameworks,  such as the United  
Nations  Programme  of Action  to Prevent,  Combat  and Eradicate  the Illicit  Trade  in Small  Arms  and 
Light  Weapons  in All its Aspects  (UN-POA)  and the Arms  Trade  Treaty;  which  are two examples  
of multilateral  instruments  aimed  at mobilizing  international  cooperation  to curb the illicit  trade  in 
conventional  arms  and ammunition.   
 Saint  Lucia  calls on the major  manufactur ers, exporters  and importers  of conventional  weapons  in 
our hemisphere  to live up to their commitments,  under  these  instruments,  to lend the necessary  
expertise  and technical  assistance  and cooperate  in good  faith to stem the tide of unregulated  
convention al arms  and ammunition.  
An Agenda  for the Youth   
Mr. President,  in his report,  “Our  Common  Agenda,”  on the future  of global  cooperation,  the UN 
Secretary  General  has proposed  several  significant  initiatives  with regard  to the Youth  of the world.   
The Repor t recommended  more  meaningful  and effective  engagement  with the youth,  including  
better  political  representation,  transforming  education,  skills  training  and lifelong  learning;  and it 
proposed  the establishment  of a United  Nations  Youth  Office  and the appo intment  of a Special  
Envoy  for Future  Generations.   
Saint  Lucia  welcomes  these  recommendations,  and is encouraged  by the adoption  of the resolution  
to establish  the Youth  Office;  as they are in keeping  with one of the key priorties  of my 
Administration  which I highlighted  in my inaugural  address  to this general  assembly  - the creation  
of the Youth  Economy.   
 I said then,  that this novel  Youth  Economy,  which  would  be formalized  in a new Government  
Department  under  the purview  of the Prime  Minister,  would  be a catalyst  for propelling  our young  
people  to turn their talents,  skills  and hobbies  into economic  enterprises  for their own 
empowerment.I am therefore  pleased  to announce  that the legislation  establishing  our Youth  Economy  Agency  has 
been  passed  and will be formally  launched  this year.   
As we call upon  all Member  States  to support  the UN Youth  Office  and Secretary  General’s’  other  
proposals  on the Youth,  we  once again  invite  the International  Community  to discuss  and engage  
with Saint  Lucia,  on mutually  beneficial  relationships  and projects  to promote  the Youth  Economy.  
In the face of today’s  drastic  interconnected  crises,  let us all together  harness  the immense  energy,  
enthusiasm,  and creativity  of our young  people;  let us capitalize  on their resourcefu lness;  let us see 
them  as assets  and not as problems  to be solved;  let us consider  their aspirations,  for the future  is 
theirs,  not ours.  
CONCLUSION  
Mr. President,  in this watershed  moment,  as we have  described  it, of interlocking  challenges,  we 
must  all accept  the truth,  that it is the ordinary  people  of this world  who matter,  the youth  in 
particular.   
It is about  the people  whom  we serve,  who made  us their leaders.  It is they,  the people,  who must  
come  first in all that we do. 
And so, Mr. President,  we have gathered  at this 77th Session  under  the theme  of “A Watershed  
Moment:  Transformative  Solutions  to Interlocking  Challenges ”- A lofty and noble  theme,  indeed,  
pregnant  with hope  and towering  expectations.  
If we truly think  of the people  of this world,  if we truly  dedicate  ourselves  to serving  them,  then our 
words,  our decisions,  our actions  will deliver,  better  health  care,  decent  employment,  decent  
housing.  
As world  leaders,  let us practice  Servant  Leadership  by faithfully  adhering  to and fulfil ling the 
obligations  of the Charter  of the United  Nations  to which  we all agreed  to abide,  when  we became  
its members.  Let us truly  be nations,  united!  
 Let us transform  our attitudes  and approach  to the less privileged.   
The more  powerful  among  us must  honour international  obligations  and responsibilities.Despite  our small  size Mr. President,  Saint  Lucia  stands  here with the self-confidence  of a people  
assured  that our history  and our own struggles  for freedom  have  earned  us the right  to be a voice  for 
all the developing  and oppressed  peoples  of the world  and we are confident,  that we have something  
to share  with the world  at this time of crises.   
I Thank  You.", LCA,2022

77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statement by the Hon. Pravind Kumar Jugnauth  
 
Prime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
23rd September 2022 | P a g e  
 President of the General Assembly  
Secretary General of the United Nations  
Excellencies  
Distinguished Delegates  
 
At the outset let me congratulate you Mr. President on your election as P resident 
of the 77th Session of the General Assembly. I wish to assure you of the full 
cooperation of my delegation in the fulfillment of your important duties.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
We are at a watershed moment in human history  when mankind is facing 
interlocking challenges whic h threaten peace, increase the level of poverty and 
are likely to considerably delay the achievements of the SDGs. At this particular  
session  your proposed theme “Solutions through Solidarity, Sustainability and 
Science” can provide us with some transforma tive solutions to address them.  
 
 Multilateralism continues to be under threat,  yet there is no other body or entity 
more representative and likely  to strengthen global cooperation than the United 
Nations.  
 
After the last three years of reeling from the Pandemic we were hoping that the 
availability of vaccines against  Covid  would  stop bleeding  our economy and that 
we would  return to normalcy. Instead , the situation has worsened due to the 
conflict in Europe which is having far and wide ramifications around the world.  
 
 
Conflicts and political instability have led to more crises  and the human tragedy 
of war has worsened. Their profound economic impact is slowing growth and 
exacerbating the cost of living crisis. There is uncertainty as to  when and how 
the conflict will end but what is clear is that t he massive influx of funds needed 
for recover y and reconstruct ion will necessar ily draw from the much needed 
assistance to countries seeking to recover from Covid. Millions of people will 
conti nue to suffer  worldwide , and millions more will be left behind.   
 
While we are still confronting an uneven recovery of the global economy, the 
pandemic recovery gap between countries is widening, creating economic and 
social reverberations around the globe  and in jecting more uncertainty into global 
markets. | P a g e  
 The rising cost of commodities and energy and in some cases their scarcity will 
further weaken our economies and delay the achievement of the SDGs.  
 
Small Island Developing States like Mauritius which are highly vulnerable  will 
be particularly affected.  
 
We make an urgent appeal to all players and the international community as a 
whole to work towards a  cessation  of hostilities and seek to resolve differences 
through peaceful means.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
This is the time when we should be  seriously thinking  of saving our planet , 
slowing down the effects of climate change , preventing a worldwide recession  and 
most importantly preventing a nuclear catastrophe .   
 
Mr. President,  
 
Climate Change  
 
We are witnessing more and more extreme weather events ; higher than ever  
temperatures, droughts, fires and floods are causing unprecedented challenges 
across the globe , and a heavy toll on human life and material damage. I take this 
opportunity to express my government’s sympathies and solidarity to the 
populations affected th roughout the world , especially in Pakistan.   
 
 COP27 gives us another chance to globally agree on  and commit to yet 
unprecedented measures to keep the temperature rise below the 1.5 degrees 
target.   
Our responsibilities as leaders and our state responsib ility should guide us in 
ensuring that our own future and that of our children are secure  and refrain 
from any action that is tantamount to ecocide.  
 
Access to climate finance is essential to address these existential threats . 
Mauritius is keen to implement its Nationally Determined Contributions which 
is estimated to cost around USD 6.5 billion. Despite the huge costs to our 
economy, Mauritius has pledged to finance 35% of the projects. We appeal to the 
international community to support us for the remaining part. | P a g e  
 The financing needs for development projects in SIDS like Mauritius should be 
demand -driven and based on the prevailing economic conditions especially in 
light of the budgeting stress created by the pandemic.  
 
We mu st also address the inequities and in this respect the UN Development 
Systems together with our development partners should use a unified compass 
and a refined and more comprehensive Vulnerability Index  which accurately 
captures SIDS vulnerabilities to  p rioritize allocation of funds and increase the 
funding of development activities.  
 
Ocean based economies are being deeply affected. Restoring the health of our 
oceans is crucial to preserve our biodiversity, community livelihoods and climate 
resilience. Negotiations for  a binding global treaty to end plastic pollution and 
the consensus reached on banning harmful fisheries are important steps in the 
right direction to turn the tides and make our oceans healthy for our sustainable 
development.  
 
Mauritius is  committed to protecting our oceans and in this context it announced 
during the Lisbon Ocean Conference the creation of a MPA around the Chagos 
Archipelago. We invite States, NGOs, and other stakeholders to support this 
initiative and assist in the creatio n,  management and enforcement of this Marine 
Protected Area  which  will be among the l argest  in the world.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
 The world is getting increasingly connected digitally and  cyber  space is invading 
almost all areas of modern day li fe. However,  while it is providing new 
opportunities it is also creating  new challenges. The pandemic has brought to 
light the role of ICT as a crucial enabler of economic and social development , but 
we need to be cautious of the misuse and abuse of this technology as well . 
 
Mauritius socio -economic vision, multi -cultural and societal values take into 
account and encourage the pursuit of a secure, and safe digital world for all as 
we strive to undermin e disinformation with accurate information. We strongly 
value the respect an d promotion of human rights both on line and off line.  We 
are equally keen to protect human values, and promote tolerance and avoid hate 
speech.  
 
In this respect, we support the efforts of the international community to 
elaborate a comprehensive Internati onal Convention on Countering the Use  of 
Information and Comm unications Technology for Criminal Purposes. | P a g e  
  
Mr. President,  
 
Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in its totality 
is in the benefit of all, for today’s and future generations.  
 
Mauritius strongly believes that we must address the concerns of our Youth for 
our future.  Even though we are con strained by our insularity and limited means 
we are striving to increase opportunities for our youth. Providing social 
protection and promoting social justice remain a key priority for our government. 
Despite very difficult economic challenges we are maint aining our social welfare 
state, inter -alia by providing free health coverage, free education and basic 
pension to the elderly.  
 
The economic empowerment of women is at the heart of various policies that we 
have adopted in Mauritius. Our government Program  is paving the way for a 
society where gender equality is adhered to ensuring fairness and equity among 
all as well as the human and social development of women.  
 
In this respect Mauritius has made significant progress towards achieving 
gender equality.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
We reaffirm our full solidarity with the Palestinian People and strongly condemn 
the senseless acts of violence against its vulnerable population.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
The recent development on the world scene is again pointing to the need for us 
to improve our ability to respond to crises , be they manmade or natural. In this 
regard, we believe that the UN system particularly the Security Council needs 
the necessary reforms to make it more representati ve of the world today and 
thereby render it more effective . In that regard we again reiterate the importance 
of expanding the Security Council with members of the African Continent, based 
on the Ezulwini Consensus  and the Sirte Declaration, as well as a member from 
SIDS , amongst others.   
  
Mr. President, | P a g e  
 The fundamental pillars of the UN, such as development, human rights, and 
international peace and security are grounded in the respect and promotion of 
international law. This essential bond between states enables the rule of law and 
global goo d governance to flourish and without which there would be chaos. 
When the UN and the institutions which we have created for upholding 
international law are not respected, democratic governance and our universal 
values are undermined.  
 
International Law ca nnot be applied selectively . It is universal, indivisible and 
essential to promote multilateralism, international cooperation and strengthen 
faith in a fair and equitable global order.  
 
 
Mr. President,  
 
 
The Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 25 February 2019, 
UN General Assembly Resolution 73/295 and the Judgment of the Special 
Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea of 28 January 2021  
have confirmed , with crystal cl arity that international law  recognises  the Chagos 
Archipelago to be and to have always been an integral part of the territory of 
Mauritius.  Yet, despite UNGA Resolution which required the colonial 
administration to withdraw within six months of the date of it s adoption,  that 
part of our territory remains occupied today. This situation further delays the 
implementation of our resettlement programme especially for those Mauritians 
of Chagossian origin who were forcibly removed from there in the 1960’s.  
 
It ill behoves to the UK to call on Mauritius and other African countries to 
respond to other allegations of illegal occupation when it illegally occupies a part 
of Africa. T he new Government of the United Kingdom has an opportunity to 
place itself on the right s ide of history and bring to a close this dark chapter of 
history  involving the l ast colony in Africa and the last colony it ever created  as 
well as the shameful forcible displacement of people . Such a move would be  fully 
consistent with the values and principles of the beloved late monarch, who we 
honour today and pay homage to.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
What more fitting tribute to the memory of this great monarch who dedicated 
her life to service, to uphold values of demo cracy, human rights and 
international law, sovereignty and territorial integrity  than to bring this history | P a g e  
 to an end  and to do so  in a manner that respects sovereignty, matters of s ecurity , 
environment and the fundamental rights of human beings.  
 
We urge  the new UK Prime Minister to act with Statesmanship and work with us 
to implement UN Resolution 73/295, support the completion of the 
Decolonisation of Mauritius and the resettlement of the former inhabitants of the 
Chagos Archipelago.  
 
I wish to report that there has indeed been some attempts to start such a 
conversation. We reached a point where it would have been possible to agree on 
a way forward  but it appears that the UK is having some difficulty in accepting 
the proposal that any final agreement must be based on international law. It 
would be most dissapointing if the inability to reach a final settlement was 
scuppered by its unwillingness to e xpress a commitment to respect the 
international Rule of Law. T he moreso that Mauritius has over the years 
confirmed that it is prepared to enter into a long -term lease to protect the 
continued operations of the military base on Diego Garcia given its cont ribution 
to regional peace and security.  
 
Mauritius is deeply grateful for the support it has been receiving from other 
countries and for actions taken by international and regional organizations, 
including the UN and its specialized agencies, to implement  General Assembly 
Resolution 73/295.  We are particularly thankful to the UN for amending its 
world map to include the Chagos Archipelago as a part of Mauritius ; to the 
Universal Postal Union for ceasing to recognise the so call ed BIOT issued stamps ; 
to the FAO for upholding the  ICJ Advisory Opinion and the  UNGA Resolutions  
and to ITLOS  for proceeding to delimit the maritime boundary between 
Mauritius and Maldives in the region of the Chagos Archipelago.  
 
I must, however, deplore the decision of  the North Indian Ocean Hydrographic 
Commission  which , at its last meeting held in Bali, violate d its legal obligations 
by failing to  recognize the legal entitlement of Mauritius which  satisfies all the 
criteria for full membership  of that organi sation . In this regard, it is with much 
regret that Mauritius has decided to suspend its participation in future activities 
of the North Indian Ocean Hydrographic Commission until its legal entitlement 
to full membership of that regional organi sation is fully recognized.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
As regards Tromelin  which also forms an integral part of the territory of 
Mauritius, we look forward to the early resolution of the dispute over that island | P a g e  
 in the spirit of friendship that characterizes the relations between Mauritius and 
France.  
 
Mr. President  
 
We have reached a once in a generation moment and we must make critical 
choices that will determine our future.  
 
The vicious cycles of violence must stop, divides and distrust must end.  We 
should not allow the winds of discord to draw  back the iron curtain, the winds 
of peace should flow smoothly. Mankind’s aspirations and yearnings for peace 
are resonating strongly on the world stage. Current geopolitical tensions should 
be de -escalated . It is time for decisive action and stronger inte rnational 
cooperatio n.  More than ever the promise to leave no one behind must guide our 
actions and forward path.  
  
It is only by working together that we can begin to weave a stronger and more 
inclusive global economy and build a better world for our sha red prosperity.  
We can and we must act now.

Statement  by 
 
THE HONOURABLE  HUʻAKAVAMEILIKU  
 
PRIME  MINISTER  of the KINGDOM  of TONGA  
 
on the occasion  of the 
 
General  Debate  
at the Seventy -seventh  Session  
of the United  Nations  General  Assembly  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Friday,  23rd September  2022  
United  Nations  Headquarters,  New York Mr. President,   
 
It is my honor  and privilege  to address  the United  Nations  General  Assembly  for the first time as Prime  
Minister  of Tonga.   
 
I offer my warmest  congratulations  to you, Mr. President,  on your election  as President  of the 77th session  
of the United  Nations  General  Assembly.   
 
I assure  you of our delegation’s  full support.  
 
May I also thank  your predecessor,  Mr. Abdulla  Shahid,  for his leadership  of the Assembly  at the 76th Session.  
He led a Presidency  of Hope  during  unprecedented  times.   
 
I also wish to commend  the tireless  efforts  of our Secretary -General,  Mr. António  Guterres . 
Thank  you, Secretary -General,  for your leadership  during  these  most  trying  times.    
 
Mr. President,  
 
Before  us is a critical,  a crucial  theme  “A watershed  moment:  transformative  solutions  to interlocking  
challenges”   
 
Our shared  planet,  our people  face complex  and multifaceted  challenges  and we must  act now.   
 
We have  the responsibility,  the duty to find common  ground.  
 
Together  we must  deliver  the transformative  solutions  needed  to build  peaceful,  inclusive,  healthy  and 
resilient  societies.  Societies  looking  with hope  to their futures  because  they can live in a planet  we sustain  in 
peace  and health  for current  and future  generations  to come.    
 
Yours,  ours is a timely  and relevant  theme  to guide  our work during  this session.   
 
The global  challenges  are vast,  they are many, they are interlinked.  They  all are ultimately  about  maintaining  
international  peace  and security.   
 
With urgency  we must,  among  so many  other  issues,  overcome  the severe    economic,  financial  and social  
impacts  of the COVID -19 Global  Pandemic,  accelerate  action  on climate  change , ocean  health,  energy  
transformation,  the sustainable  use of natural  resources,  cybersecurity  and I could  go on. 
For this, we must  unite  and we must  be determine d to work  together  for solutions.  The very peaceful  existence  
of humanity  and that of the planet  hosting  us are at stake.   
 
We must  unite  to find the way forward  in an equitable  multi -lateral  system  and a cooperation  fit for purpose,  
fit for the future  and respectful  of our differences  but united  by our shared  desire  for an inclusive,  hopeful  and 
sustainable  future  for all.  
 
Mr. President   
 
Earlier  this year,  Tonga  co-sponsored  several  UN General Assembly  Resolutions  in support  of the people  of 
Ukraine. We continue  to urge a peaceful  resolution  of the conflict  to save  unnecessary  loss of lives and minimise  any 
further  devastations.  
 
Tonga  is far away  from this conflict .  
 
Yet, its ripple  effects are felt by all of us.  
 
Tonga,  like so many  others,  are faced  with higher  costs  of fuel, food,  and basic  supplies . 
Inflation  is double -digit. These  are inflation  rates  that we have  not experienced  in decades.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
More  than ever,  it is urgent that we progress  toward  implementing  the goals  of Agenda  2030  set seven  years  
ago.  
 
At half-time,  the reality  is that the existential  threats  from climate  change,  pandemics,  and conflict  have  
increased . This is not some  temporary  inconvenience .  
 
Let us admit  that situations  have  worsened  since  we last met.  
 
This is also why we thank  the Secretary -General  for his Sustainable  Development  Goals  Report  2022 . 
 
I believe  this provides  a “roadmap  out of crises” .  
 
The promises  of the Global  Agenda  we agreed  to risks to be a promise  we did not keep.  
 
We must  keep  our promises  especially  to the vulnerable  populations  such  as those  of small  island  developing  
states.   
 
We must  focus . 
 
There  are areas  which  need  immediate  action  to rescue  the SDGs  and deliver  meaningful  progress  for people  
and the planet  by 2030.   
 
Mr. President,  
 
The successor  agreement  to the SAMOA  Pathway  will be critical  and notably  in regard  of the support  by the 
international  community  for SIDS . 
 
SIDS  are and must  remain  a special  case  for development . 
 
We are not a footnote,  we face unique  vulnerabi lities.   
 
Once  again,  it is with urgency  that we call on all states  to show  solidarity  with the peoples  of the SIDS.  
 
We call on your support  especially  so during  the preparatory  process  for the SAMOA  successor  arrangement.  
Only  a few short  years  remain  to implement  the SAMOA  Pathway. Mr President,  
 
Tonga  welcomes  the UN Secretariat  work  on a monitoring  framework  for the SAMOA  pathway  
implementation.  
 
Already  three  decades  have  elapsed  since  small  island  developing  states  called  for an index recognizing  our 
special  circumstances  and vulnerabilities.   
 
The international  financial  system  has used  measures  not necessarily  adapted  to our special  circumstances,  
our challenges,  and our ecological  and economic  vulnerabilities.   
 
This has limited  our access  to appropriate  financing,  debt relief,  and aid.  
Greater  responsiveness  to our special  circumstances  has come  about  over time by taking  into account  the 
unique  factors  affect ing the entire  range  of our political,  social,  economic  and environmental  development  
issues.  
 
We express  appreciation  to the Prime  Minister  of Antigua  & Barbuda  and the UN High Level  Panel  for the 
release  of the Interim  Report  on the Development  of a Multidi mensional  Vulnerability  Index.  We look forward  
to its finalisation  and its adoption  by December  2022.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Tonga,  like so many  of our Pacific  neighbours,  faces  natural  disasters  of unprecedented  severity  and 
frequency.  
 
This threaten s our very existence  and certainly  our efforts  for an inclusive  and sustainable  development  of a 
small  econom y like Tonga.    
 
All Tongans  will forever  recall  the 15th of January  2022 .  
 
The Hunga -Tonga -Hunga  Ha’apai volcano  erupted.   
 
The explosion  was of an intensit y so great  that some  research  compares  it to the impact  of a nuclear  
explosion . 
 
We made  the news  of the world.  Not the news  we looked  for. 
 
Research  documents  that the explosion  may have  created  a tsunami  almost  as high as the Statue  of Liberty . 
 
Plumes  of hot gas, ash, and water  vapour  were  projected  into the atmosphere,  reaching  a height  of 36 miles.   
 
The ensuing  tsunami  devastated  our economy.  
 
Several  islands  were  completely  or severely  destroyed . People  were  displaced  and then evacuated  to 
neighbouring  islands.   
 
The volcanic  eruption  and tsunami  cut access  to basics  for people  and cut a precious  lifeline  for an island  
nation,  our communication s. The widespread  economic  and social  damage  and sadly  loss of lives, is estimated  by the World  Bank  at 
36.4%  of Tonga’s  GDP.  
 
In our hour of need,  we recognize  with our deep est appreciation  the response  from Member  States  and their 
peoples . 
 
We recogniz e the support  of the philanthropic  institutions,  the United  Nations  System  and other  
Intergovernmental  Organizations,  Development  Partners,  the private  sector,  Non-Government  
Organizations,  and Individuals.   
 
Thank  you, Malo  Aupito,  for standing  in solidarity  with Tonga  at our hour of difficulty.    
 
My government  has renewed  our national  priorities . We must  build  back  better  and build  national  resilience  
to external  threats  and risks;  improve  the quality  of services  and affordability  to the community,  and achieve  
progressive  and sustainable  economic  growth.  
 
We are commit ted to reduce  the risks and the harmful  effects  of natural  disasters,  particularly  through  risk 
informed  development  efforts,  through  enhancing  disaster  preparedness  for effective  response.   
 
Mr. President,  
 
Then,  in February  of this year,  after two years  of keeping  COVID -19 at bay through  the closure  of our border,  
Tonga  experienced  its first community  outbreak.   
 
Over  the previous  two years  we vaccinate d our people.   
 
I must  thank  Tonga’s  development  partners  for providing  support,  both directly  and through  the COVAX  
Facility.   
 
We also acknowledge  the support  provided  by UNICEF  and the WHO  on infection,  prevention,  control,  risk 
communication,  and surveillance.   
 
This support  was critical  to Tonga’s  preparedness  and response  plan. 
 
It enabled  a nationwide  vaccination  program  for those  aged  12 years  and older.    
 
Finally,  on 1st August  this year we could  again  open  our borders . We do so, emphasizing  preventative  health  
measures  to mitigate  risks and ensure  a safe reopening.   
 
Mr. President,  
 
Tonga  has one of the world’s  highest  rates  of non-communicable  diseases  (NCDs)  globally.  NCDs,  such  
as cardiovascular  disease,  cancers,  diabetes,  and chronic  respiratory  diseases , account  for approximately  
80% of deaths  in Tonga.   
 
We must  provide  continuous  support  to meet  our current  goal,  in line with the SDG  Goal  of reducing  NCD -
related  deaths  by one-third by the year 2030. Mr. Presi dent,  
 
Climate  Change  continues  to be the single  greatest  existential  threat  facing  the Blue Pacific.   
 
The adverse  impacts  of climate  change  make  Tonga  the third most  vulnerable  country  in the world . 
 
This threatens  our territorial  integrity,  land,  water,  health,  infrastructure,  food security,  biological  diversity,  
livelihoods,  and ecosystem s. 
 
It threatens  peoples’  mental  health  and our sense  of nationhood.   
 
Climate  change  is an existential  threat  to people  and our desire  for international  peace  and security . 
 
We reiterate  our call for this issue  to be a permanent  item on the Security  Council’s  agenda . 
 
The Security  Council  must  be seized  of the matter  because  of its clear  links to traditional  threats  to 
international  peace  and security.   
 
Whether  it is sea-level rise, loss of territory,  and the mass  migration  it leads  to, this is a trigger  for violence  
and a threat  to peace  and secu rity. 
 
Mr. President,  
 
Tonga  is a large  ocean  state . 
 
99% of our sovereign  territory  is the ocean  and through  generations  we have shown  a serious  responsibility  
to protect  the ocean.   
 
The ocean  is our beating  heart,  it serves  as the foundation  for our economy  and the lifeline  for sectors  from 
tourism  to fisheries  to ocean  transport  and international  shipping.    
 
The conservation  and sustainable  use of the ocean  and its resources  is at the forefront  of our concerns  and 
interests.   
 
Tonga  joins member  states  that argued  for the importance  of the ocean  and seas  to global  sustainable  
development.   
 
Tonga  aspires  to play its role in the fight against  illegal,  unreported  and unregulated  (IUU)  fishing  activities,  
particularly  in responding  to mitigating  IUU risks.     
 
We must  achieve  the goals  outlined  in SDG14  if we are to survive.  Anything  less is unacceptable,  and we 
must  do whatever  we can within  our available  resources.  We were  pleased  to participate  at the 7th Our Ocean  
Conference  in Koror,  Palau  and the 2nd United  Nations  Ocean  Conference  (UNOC)  held in Lisbon,  Portugal  
and we look forward  to continuing  such  conferences  to ensure  that ocean  and seas  are a priority  in the Global  
sustainable  development  agenda.  It is through  such  engage ment  that partnerships  were  formed  and resulted  
in Tonga  producing  its first ever Tonga  Ocean  Management  Plan 2021. Mr. President  
 
Tonga  continues  to recognize  the importance  of the legal  mandate  provided  by the United  Nations  
Convention  on the Law of the Sea.  
 
As a member  of the International  Seabed  Authority,  Tonga  continuously  engages  in the work  of the Authority . 
We must  expeditiously  conclude  those  Exploitation  Regulations  which  ensure  that appropriate  conservation  
and environmental  management  practices  are in place  when  exploitation  activities  begin.    
 
Mr. President,  
 
The conservation  and protection  of our high seas  remain  a priority  for Tonga . 
 
I refer in particular  to the negotiations  to conclude  an international  legally  binding  instrument  under  the United  
Nations  Convention  on the Law of the Sea on the conservation  and sustainable  use of marine  biological  
diversity  of areas  beyond  national  jurisdiction.   
 
Tonga  is optimistic  that the considerable  amount of work  that has gone  into this process,  along  with further  
progress  on resolving  key issues  of divergence,  will enable  us to come  to a positive  conclusion .  
 
Let us conclude  this historical  instrument  to support  our obligations  under  UNCLOS.   
 
Mr. President,  
 
Tonga  has a large  proportion  of our people  living  in diaspo ras near and far with two out of three  Tongans  
living  overseas . 
 
Remittances  equal some  40% of GDP.   
 
This is why it is of concern  to us to find ways  to reduce  the cost of remittances . 
 
Mr. President,   
 
I am honoured  to be appointed  as President  of the sixth session  of the Assembly  of SIDS  DOCK.   
 
In this capacity,  I launched  the Global  Ocean  Energy  Alliance  (or GLOEA),  on 29th June  2022  in Lisbon,  
Portugal.   
 
The GLOEA  is an initiative  focused  on accelerating  the development  of ocean  energy  technologies  and 
projects  through  partnerships  that mobilize  technical,  human,  and financial  resources  and aim to establish  a 
global  community  of shared  interest . A community  capable  of developing  a pipeline  of bankable  ocean  energy  
projects  to serve  islands,  cities,  and coastal  nations.  
 
As the 2022  events  so cruelly  showed  us, internet  connectivity  is a lifeline  for Tonga . 
 
Our economy  and our society  are dependent  on well functioning  domestic  and international  communications. The security  required  to protect  such  connectivity  is therefore  vital for our sustainable  development.  In this 
regard,  I wish to recognize  the work  of the ITU and UNESCO’S  Broadband  Commission  for sustainable  
development.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Education  is at the core of peace  and sustainable  futures.   
 
Tonga  recognizes  and welcomes  the opportunity  to share  in the Transforming  Education  Summit  held earlier  
this week.   
 
The summit  provided  an opportunity  to once  again  reiterate  our collective  call to put education  front and 
center  for our inclusive  and sustainable  development  for ALL.  
 
We must  build  future -proof,  sustainable,  and resilient  education  systems.  For this, we must  scale  up financial  
investment.   
 
Mr. Preside nt, 
 
Pacific  Islands  Forum  Leaders  have  committed  to strong  regional  action  for a shared  stewardship  of the 
Pacific  Ocean . 
 
The Pacific  Ocean  covers  one-third of our planet’s  surface  and it is our desire  to act as one Blue Pacific  
Continent.   
 
We continue  to note with grave  concern  the threat  posed  by sea-level rise to our Blue Pacific . We commit  
ourselves  to ensure  that climate  change -induced  sea-level rise must  not challenge  our maritime  zones  
delineated  under  UNCLOS  as reflected  in the “2021  Declaration  on Preserving  Maritime  Zones  in the face of 
Climate  Change -related  Sea-level rise”. 
 
We note the invaluable  work  of the International  Law Commission,in  particular,  the Study  Group  on Sea-
Level  Rise for its work  in advancing  deliberations  on this topic  with the view to strengthening  the UNCLOS  
framework,  particularly  in addressing  the modern  realities  of sea-level rise. 
 
We further  note the high Debt  Sustainability  Analysis  of Forum  Island  Countries  and emphasise  the need  
for debt instruments  to be simple,  manageable  and implementable  given  countries’  limited  resources,  the 
time-bound  nature  of debt instruments  and the increasingly  constrained  development  finance  landscape  
worldwide.   
 
We also committed  to revitalising  the Pacific  Leaders  Gender  Equality  Declaration  in 2023.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Our Pacific  collective  will and remains  our strength  in our advocacy  for faster  and more  action  by the 
international  community.    
 
Vanuatu’s  initiative  to seek  an Advisory  Opinion  from the ICJ on the obligations  of states  under  international  
law to protect  the rights  of present  and future  generations  against  the adverse  impacts  of climat e change , to clarify  the legal  consequences  of climate  change.  Tonga  joined  all of the other  Pacific  Leaders  in supporting  
this initiative,  and a step in the right direction.  
 
The initiative  by Tuvalu  and Antigua  & Barbuda  to establish  a Commission  of SIDs  on climate  change  and 
international  law that will be tasked  with developing  and implementing  fair and just global  environmental  
norms  and practices  is also a step in the right direction.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
I conclude  by reiterating  Tonga’s  support  for your important  work . 
 
May we show  resolve,  courage  and partnership  to meet  the challenges  before  us and turn the needle  to hope  
for present  and future  generations.   
 
May God guide  and bless  this august  General  Assembly  and all its members,  observers,  and staff in our 
shared  journey  during  this session  to the destination  of finding  solutions  through  solidarity,  sustainability,  and 
science.  
 
I thank  you.", TON,2022
 GRC_77_2022," 
 Monsieur le President,  
Mr. Secretary General,  
Heads of States and Governments,  
Excellences ,  
Mesdames et Messieurs , 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
Seventy -seven years ago, thi s organization was founded out of the chaos 
of war with one stated aim: the harmonization of relations among nation 
states in pursuit of lasting peace and security,  the defense  of human rights 
and the inviolability of international law. It was t he world’s multilateral 
response to the aggression  of the few at the expense o f the many.  
 
And yet, in spite of all its successes, today our ‘United Nations ’ stand s at 
a crossroads. As the theme of this year’s General Assembly suggests, we 
face a ‘watershed moment’  in world history. We face a choice. And that 
choice is simple.  
 
We can come together to face down the  forces of authoritarianism  and 
violence  of today, in full cognizance that there is a price to pay for 
defending our  common human  values .  Or  we can show indecision, we 
can waver , and ultimately , we can fold.  
 
Choose the former , however painful  in the short term that may be , and the 
values that underpin these United Nations will prevail. Choose the latter 
and the consequences are , I believe , unimaginable. ** 
 For our societies  to survive and thrive, they have to be willing to fight when 
faced with unprovoked aggression. Pericles in his funeral oration made 
that absolutely clear  2500 years ago. At no time after the end of the 
Second World War have his words echoed more relevant.  
 
Today t he memories of the Dark Continent  have resurfaced after the 
unprovoked invasion of Russia into Ukraine. What we considered 
unthinkable has hap pened.  
 
For many years we believed that international cooperation and a shared 
commitment to the rule of law had prevail ed over guns and armies. We 
believed that given the tragic and devastating experiences  of the twentieth 
century, no one would venture to suppres s another people’s right to exist 
or alter borders by force.  We were wrong.      
 
Nevertheles s, as Europeans  we have every reason to be proud of our 
response .  We have stood by Ukraine, equipping it with means to defend  
itself against the aggressor.  We have imposed punitive sanctions that are 
beginning to take a toll on the Russian economy. And the tide is beginning 
to turn.   
 
This clear and strong position against an unjustified war is the reflection 
of a new geopolitical vision of the European Union. We  don’t want a world 
in which power is for the strong state and not for the weak, and where 
disputes are settled by generals rather tha n diplomats . ** 
 Russia ’s invasion  must  not succeed. Not only for t he sake of Ukraine . But 
also because it is imperative to send a clear message to other 
authoritarian leaders that open acts of aggression which violate 
international law shall not be tolerated by the global community of 
democratic states.   
 
This message had been sent loud and clear by many heads of state and 
government who have taken the floor at this year’s General Assembly.  
 
Across  Europe we face the prospect of a difficult winter.  The impact of the 
war in Ukraine has sent the price of gas soaring and has unleashed a 
spike in inflation, the likes of which we have not seen in more than four 
decades.  
 
Russia has weaponized its natural resources to cause pain on European 
societies and destabilize democratically elected European governments.  
Again, it will not succeed.  
 
We will support ou r citizens to cope with high energy prices.  We will pool 
European resources t o promote energy efficiency and rapidly diversify 
away from Russian oil and natural gas.   
 
And we will further accelerate the push towards renewables, which are 
not just the cleanest and cheapest for m energy , but are also the safest 
ones from a geopolitic al perspective.  ** 
 Never again must we mortgage our prosperity, only to be blackmailed by 
those who are willing to exploit our dependencie s. This is, after all, what 
European strategic autono my is all about.  
 
We know that there is a price to be paid for being on the right side of 
history. And it is our obligation to keep our societies united but also 
informed about what is really at stake  in Ukraine.   
 
The fight against disinformation and fake news must continue with 
increased vigor.   Pericles was correct when he said that “it is not easy to 
find the right measure of words when one cannot quite rely on a common  
perception of the truth” .   
 
Ladies and gentlemen,  
 
Ukraine is not the only country in post -war Europe to have been brutally 
attacked . For nearly 50 years,  Cypriots have lived on a divided island as 
the result of an illegal invasion and a military occupation.  
 
Ankara and the Turkish -Cypriot  leadership, i solated and alone in the 
international  community , continue to insist upon  unacceptable demands 
for a two -state solution . They refuse  to resume negotiations for an agreed 
settlement on the basis of successive Security Council Resolutions.  ** 
 Greece strongly supports both the Secretary General’s efforts to resume 
negotiations for a mutually acceptable settlement, and the Confidence 
Building Measures proposed by the President of the Republic of Cyprus , 
Nikos Anastasiadis.  
 
But the international  community must not ignore illegal Turkish attempts 
to impose a new fait -accompli on Cyprus, in particular in the fenced area 
of Varosha, as well as new and repeated violations of Cyprus’ maritime 
zones and airspace.  
 
Which brings me , ladies and gentlemen , to an issue even closer to home  
for my country . I am referring to Turkiye’s continued and ever more 
aggressive revision ist agenda  vis a vis  Greece.  
 
This is my fourth address to the General Assembly as Greek Prime 
Minister.  You have heard me say before that I am always open to 
dialogue , and to  the settling of differences in an open , respectful manner, 
and in accordance with international law. This is still the case.  
 
Turkiye after all is an important country, a NATO  member , which  can be 
a partner and ally of Greece and the European Union , if it so chooses .    
 
Turkiye has great capacity to play a constructive role. For example , 
Ankara’s  recent efforts  that led to a  successful  UN brokering  of a grain 
exports deal between Ukraine and Russia  is an important contribution  to 
global  food security. ** 
 But a t the same time,  Turkiye continues to play a  destabilizing role in the 
Eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Caucasus.  It is also the 
only NATO country not implementing sanctions against Russi a. 
 
When it comes to Greece, Turkiye’s leadership seems to have a strange 
fixation  with my country . Their language is increasingly bellicose . They  
threaten  that Turk iye will “come at night ”, if it so decide s. This is the 
language of an aggressor not a peacemaker . Sadly,  it is nothing new.  
 
And what of Turk iye’s challenge to the Greek sovereignty in the Aegean  
itself?  Again, t his rhetoric  not new.  Turkiye has been  incrementally 
building a  comprehensive  narrative of false claims  in the Aegean  that 
stretches from the Imia is let crisis  in the mid -1990s to the present day.    
 
It has been  threatening Greece with a casus belli , should we choose to 
exercise our sovereign right to expand out territorial waters in the Aegean . 
 
This narrative  has culminat ed in Turkiye’s preposterous  challeng e, last 
year, of Greek sovereignty over the Eastern Aegean islands , including 
islands such as Chios and  Rhodes,  a sovereignty  which was established 
by international treaties  100 years ago.  ** 
 What is particularly alarming is the growing intensity of the threat . It is  
characterized by an escala tion in  aggressive  rhetoric . Combined with a 
massive disinformation campaign . Multiple violations of Greece’s 
sovereignty and sovereign rights at sea and in the air, the 
instrumentalization of migration flows, and a unilateral decision to refuse  
all high -level contacts .  
 
And I ask.  Is this behavior compatible with a well -established international 
actor, a UN member state, bound by the UN Charter and principles?  
 
Such actions  undermine peace  and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean 
at a time when the international community is faced with a war in Ukraine.   
 
If President Erdogan wants to talk about red lines, then I say this: Turkish 
claims over the sovereignty of Greece’s islands are basel ess and 
unacceptable .  
 
Questioning the sovereignty of Greek territory crosses a red line for all 
Greeks. As Prime Minister of Greece,  I will never compromise on my 
country’s territorial integrity, security and stability.  Greece will not be 
bullied by anyone.  
 
And yet, it does not have to be this way.  There is another path forward. 
Greek people and  Turkish people also have a history of peaceful 
coexistence. 8 years after the tragic events of 1922, Greek and Turkish 
leaders had the courage to sign a Peac e and Friendship Agreement. ** 
 That is why today I would like to address not just the Turkish leadership 
but also the Turkish people directly with this message: Greece poses no 
threat to your country.  We are not your enemy. We are neighbors. We 
value the many friendships between ordina ry Greeks and Turks.  
 
I know that the vast majority in our two countries do not want political 
conflict and hostility. So, let us move forward in a spirt of cooperation and 
friendship, with mutual respect, and in accordance with international law.  
 
Let me also make a specific reference to the migration situation in the 
Aegean. Turk iye has been instrumentalizing migrants since March 2020, 
when it actively encouraged and facilitated tens of thousands of desperate 
people to illegally cross into Greece i n order to put pressure on the 
European Union.   
 
I want to be absolutely clear. Greece will continue to protect its borders, 
with full respect to fundamental rights. Our Coast Guard has saved tens 
of thousands of people at sea. It did so again yesterday w hen we rescued 
more than 130 people, including many children, from two sinking boats in 
the Aegean.  
 
It would be more useful for Turk iye to cooperate actively with Greece and 
Europe on the issue of migration rather that spreading fake news.  After 
all, the  boats carrying the same desperate people President Erdogan 
keeps referring to leave the Turkish coast in broad  daylight… ** 
 Ladies and gentlemen,  
 
Let me conclude with a point about meeeting  the momentous challenge 
of climate change.  
 
The g reen transformation  sits at the heart of my government’s reform 
programme . Our National Climate Law aims to mobilize all sectors of the 
economy as we establish a roadmap for our transition to net zero by 
2050.  
 
The conversion of a number of Greek islands into green innovation hubs  
is up and running.  
 
And for  Greece there is another fight close to our hearts. The battle to 
protect cultural heritage , not just from climate change , but from armed 
conflict, illicit trafficking and its interconnection with terroris t financing , and 
religious fundamentalism.  
 
Greece , in partnership with UNESCO and the W MO, has launched 
“Addressing Climate Change Impacts on Cultural and Natural Heritage”, 
an initiative supported by more than 100 member -states, the  Secretary 
General, the Council of Europe and the UNFCCC. We invite all member 
states to join us in this effort . ** 
 And, I’m pleased to say that in our long and continuing effort to reunite the 
Parthenon Sculptures we have received support from the vast majority of 
member states, as well as from UNESCO’s Intergovernmental 
Committee.  
 
We thank you for that support.  No m atter how long it will take, the 
Parthenon Sculptures will eventually be coming home.  
 
Distinguished delegates , 
 
I am immensely proud of the fact that Greece is one of few  countries  who 
have not deviated from any of the UN’s 17 Sustainability Goals for 2030.  
Let me highlight in particular our commitment to transforming public 
education, in line with Goal Number 4.  Our efforts  have been re cognized 
at this year’s assembly . 
 
As the world’s leading shipping nation,  we understand  that the 
sustainability of our marine environment is  of paramount  importance . 
Which is why in 2024 we will be hosting the 9th International “Our Ocean 
Conference” , build ing on our ambitious plans to promote sustainable 
fishing  and protect 30% of our land and sea by 2030 .  
 
All these initiatives prove that collective multilateral solution s can make a 
significant difference in the battle to protect our natural world.  ** 
 But we are not there yet. Whether it be the terrifying wildfires we witnessed 
in Europe  this summer , or more recently the unprecedented flooding that 
affected large parts of Pakista n, or the continued loss of critical icecaps, 
glaciers and rainforests , without multilateral cooperation , these events 
may soon be the norm rather than the exception.  
 
Greece is taking the lead in making sure that European countries 
cooperate more effectively in the field of civil protection through the 
RescEU pr ogram.  
 
As the United Kingdom hands on the baton and the work of COP26 to 
Egypt for COP27, we have a final  chance to get this right. Let us  not be 
asking at the next General Assembly why we are still talking and not 
acting . 
 
The challenges our world faces our complex and multifaceted. The 
solutions are far from simple. They require compromise and effort and will. 
They require resolve and determination. Above  all, they require us to work 
together and stay the course. That after all in the spirit of these United 
Nations. ** 
 In the pursuit of freedom, in the preservation of democracy and the rule of 
law, and in the fight against climate change, there is a long road ahead.   
 
The next generations  will judge us harshly should we fail to rise to the 
occasion.   
 
Thank you.", GRC,2022

 Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim  
Mr. President,  
Assalamu Alaikum and Good afternoon.  
I heartily congratulate you on your elect ion as the President of the 
77th session of the United Nations General Assembly. I assure you of my 
delegation ’s full cooperation throughout the session. I also commend your 
predecessor His Excellency  Mr. Abdullah S hahid.  
I would like to express my deep appreciation to  the Secretary -
General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his strong  commitment to making the 
United Nations more vibrant in its responsibilities.  
The theme of this year's general debate  is: “A watershed moment: 
transformative solutions to interlocking challenges ”.  
Our planet Earth today is plagued by multiple complex and multi -
dimensional challenges like climate change, violence and conflict, and the 
Covid -19 pandemic. This year's theme calls f or united efforts to find ways 
to overcome these challenges and revitalize our economy to build a 
peaceful and sustainable world. And to achieve this goal we need to act 
collectively without any delay . 
Mr. President,  
As the world begins to recover from the  devastating effects of the 
coronavirus pandemic over the past two and a half years, the  recent  
Russia -Ukraine conflict has plunged the world  further  into a grave 
uncertainty. Escalating  food insecurity, energy  and economic crisis are 
affecting us all. Countries that are already in vulnerable situation needing 
support to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will now 
face even more challenges to achieve the SDGs.Please check against delivery

 Today we have reached a critical time  and situation , when mutual 
solidarity must be shown more than ever. We need to prove that  in times 
of crisis,  the United Nations  remains the cornerstone of the multilateral 
system . Therefore, in order to gain the trust and confidence of the people 
of all c ountries and all segments , the United Nations must lead from the 
forefront and work to fulfill the expectations of all  of us .  
We believe that antagonism like war or economic sanctions, 
counter -sanctions  can never bring good to any nation. Mutual d ialogue  is 
the best way to resolve crises and disputes.  
In this context, I thank the U nited Nations  Secretary General for 
setting up the Global Crisis Response Group. As a champion of this group, 
I am working with other world leaders to determine a global solutio n 
commensurate with the gravity and depth of the current situation.  
Mr. President,  
The Father of the N ation of Bangladesh , Bangabandhu She ikh 
Mujibur Rahman , formulated our foreign policy dictum ‘ friendship to all, 
malice towards none’. Bangladesh has been  pursuing this  principle of 
non-alignment since its independence .  
In his  maiden  address to this great Assembly on 25 September 1974, 
he said - I quote ‘Our total commitment to peace is born of the realization 
that only an environment of peace would enable us to enjoy the fruits of 
our hard -won national independence and to mobilize and concentrate all 
our energies and resources in combating the scourges of poverty, hunger, 
disease, illiteracy and unemployment. We therefore welcome every effort 
aimed a t advancing the process of detente, relaxation of tension, limitation 
of armaments and the promotion of peaceful coexistence in every part of 
the world, whether in Asia, Africa, Europe or Latin America. ’ - unquote.Please check against delivery

 This s tatement of Bangabandhu  Sheikh Muji b is still equally 
relevant in the present global context. Bangabandhu believed that peace 
is the embodiment of the aspirations of all men and women in the world.  
As a result of war, human beings, especially women  and children , suffer 
tremendously . Many pe ople become refugee s.  
Mr. President,  
Since the beginning of the pandemic in Bangladesh, we have taken 
strategies to contain this crisis mainly focusing on three aspects . First, we 
expanded national health care to prevent the transmission and spread of 
the infection ; second , we have provided strategic fiscal stimulus to 
safeguard our economy; a nd thirdly, we have secured people's livelihood. 
These initiatives have helped reduce the number o f deaths due to 
pandemic  as well as reduce public  suffering s.  
Vaccination is the key to our safe transition from the pandemic. We 
thank the World Health Organization and its COVAX system and our 
partner countries for providing this vacc ine. As of August 2022,  100 
percent  of the eligible  population of Bangladesh  have been vaccinated.   
Mr. President,  
We are working towards sustainable economic growth, creating 
equal opportunities for all and realizing an inclusive peaceful society and 
social harmony.  
Bangladesh is now one of the five fastest growing economies in the 
world. We are 41st in terms of GDP.  We have reduced the poverty rate 
from 41 percent to 20.5 percent in the last decade. Our per capita income 
has tripled  to 2,824 US dollars in just a decade.Please check against delivery  
Page 5 of 13 
 Before the outbreak of Covid -19 pandemic , our GDP growth rate in 
Fiscal Year 2018 -19 was 8.15 percent. Earlier, we achieved GDP growth 
of over 7 percent for three consecutive years. Even in the midst of the 
pandemic, the economy of Bangladesh expanded by 6.94 percent in the 
fiscal year 2020 -21. 
However, as a result of the Russia -Ukraine  war, economic sanctions  
and counter -sanctions there has been a supply chain disruption and 
exorbitant price hike of fuel, food and consumer goods . This has brought 
the economy like ours  under tremendous pressure.  Inflation has been 
increased. We are taking various initiatives to overcome this situation.  
In 2026, Bangladesh is going to graduate from Least Developed 
Countries  category to a developing country. We are working towards 
transforming Bangladesh into a knowledge -based developed country by 
2041 and building a prosperous and climate -resilient delta by 2100.  
Mr President,  
Bangladesh has achieved significant progress in universal primary 
education, food security, reduction of maternal and child mortality, 
gender equality, women empowerment etc. Literacy rate has increased 
from 50 percent to 75 percent in the last decade. We have emphasiz ed 
greatly  on ensuring I nformation Technology -based education system.  
Our inf ant mortality rate has declined  to 21 per thousand and 
maternal mortality rate has reduced to 173 per hundred thousand live 
births. The average life expectancy of our people is now more than 73 
years.  
We have paid  special attention to the most vulnerable people in the 
society so that no one is left behind. The coverage of the existing social 
safety net has been expanded to ensure social  and financial security ofPlease check against delivery  
Page 6 of 13 
 destitute  women, widows, the elderly , persons with di sabilities,  third 
gender  people,  and other vulnerable segment of the society . Currently, 
about 10.7 million people are receiving direct benefit s under the social 
safety net.  
Improved physical infrastructure serves as the foundation for a 
strong economic st ructure.  That is why we are building massive 
sustainable infrastructure, including under -water  tunnels, elevated 
expressways and mass rapid transit systems. Recently we have added 
“Padma Multi -purpose Bridge” - a self -funded asset to our road 
communication s system. It will facilitate Bangladesh's local and 
international trade and enhance regional connectivity.  This will ensure at 
least 1.23 percent growth in our national income.  
Mr. President,  
The impact of climate change is one of the biggest threats for th e 
humankind. In the past, we have seen a vicious cycle of promises being 
made and broken. We must now change this course.  
In Bangladesh, we have led to many transformative measures to 
tackle perilous impacts of climate change consistent with implementing 
the Paris Agreement and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. 
During our Presidency of Climate Vulnerable Forum, we launched ‘Mujib 
Climate Prosperity Plan’, which aims to put Bangladesh on a sustainable 
trajectory from “one of vulnerability to resi lience and climate prosperity”.  
Our national plans and policies on climate change and natural 
disaster have been made  gender responsive .  
We are ready to support other vulnerable countries to develop their 
own prosperity plans.  I call on world leaders to promote inclusive climate 
action s.Please check against delivery

 Mr. President,  
Migrants continue to face precarious situations i n their migration 
journeys, be  denied of their rights. To overcome this situation, we must 
enhance global p artnership and solidarity. The ‘ Global  Compact on 
Migration’ along with its  ‘Progress Declaration’  gives us an excellent 
roadmap in this regard.  
Today, the complex global crises have reversed decades of 
development gains of many developing countries. The realization of the 
2030 Agenda appears to be a far -fetched dream for many of them at this 
moment. They need targeted support in areas that are severely impacted 
including health, education, decent job, and agriculture. There is no better 
way than harnessing the potentials of Science, Technology  and 
Innovation.  
We are witnessing how frontier technologies are rapidly changing 
the world. It is imperative that everyone, everywhere gets fair and equal 
access to these technologies. The burgeoning digital divide must be 
bridged.  
Sixteen countries, incl uding Bangladesh, are now on t rack to 
graduate from the list of L east Developed countries . However, the 
evolving global crises have posed serious challenges to our sustainable 
graduation. We urge the development partners for enhanced and tailored 
support. We welcome the Doha Programme of Action in this regard.  
Mr. President,  
After the peaceful settlement of maritime boundaries with the

 We are committed to working with global partners for the 
sustainable use, conservation and management of our marine resources to 
accelerate our socio -economic development.  
Effective implementation of the provisions of th e UN Convention 
on the Law of the Sea is imperative in harnessing sustainable utilization 
of ocean resources.  
In this regard I also call upon the member States to work closely to 
bridge the gaps and conclude the much -needed international instrument 
on the  conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of 
areas beyond national jurisdiction, known as BBNJ.  
Mr President,  
We are fully committed to complete disarmament, including the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We ratified the landmar k Treaty on 
the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons  (TPNW)  in 2019.   
We have consistently implemented our commitment to 
peacekeeping operations.  As a reflection of our peace -centric foreign 
policy, we are contributing to the highest number of troops and police in 
the UN peacekeeping missions . They help maintain peace, support 
capacity building of national and local institutions, protect the civilians 
from harms, empower women and other vulnerable communities and 
build  a sustainable society. While perform ing the se duties, many of them  
sacrificed their lives . 
We believe without addressing root causes of conflict, we cannot 
sustain peace. As the current Chair of the UN Peacebuilding Commission, 
we are doing our part by creating platform for multi -stakeholder 
engagements in support of the conflict affected countries.Please check against delivery

 We are committed to continue our efforts in strengthening the 
women, peace and security (WPS) agenda.  
We have ado pted a 'zero tolerance' policy on terrorism and violent 
extremism. We do not allow our territory to be used by any party to incite 
or cause terrorist acts or harm to others.  
I also call upon Member States to work together for conclusion of 
an internationally binding instrumen t to tackle cyber -crime s and cyber -
violence.  
Mr. President,  
As a responsible member state, Bangladesh is fully committed to 
protecting and promoting the human rights of its  own people.  We have 
adopted a holistic and inclusive approach to ensure the political, 
economic, cultural a nd social rights of the people.  
For example, we have adopted  legal provision s to ensure the  rights 
and welfare of the people  belonging to third gender . 
 We have been implementing  a project namely ‘Ashrayan ’ to 
provide free housing to all homeless and landless families  of the country . 
Since 1997, during the tenure of my government  for 18 years , we have 
provided housing to  more than 3.5 million people .  
We believe, c ontinued democratic polity and norms can en sure 
people’s socio -economic emancipation.  
Mr. President,  
We will continue to extend o ur support to the Palestinian people . I 
reiterate Bangladesh’ s unequivocal support for the two -state solution 
based on pre -1967 borders and the establishment of a Palestinian state 
with East Jerusalem as its capital.Please check against delivery

 Mr. President,  
I sha ll now seek your attention to the forcibly displaced Rohingya 
peoples from Myanmar. Last month we witnessed the five years of the 
2017 mass exodus of the Rohingyas to Bangladesh from  their home 
country.  
Despite our bilateral engagements with Myanmar, discussions with 
partners in trilateral format and engagements with the UN and other 
partners , not a single Rohingya  was repatriated to their ancestral home s in 
Myanmar . The ongoing political turmoil and armed conflicts in the 
country has made the repatriation of the displaced Rohingyas even more 
difficult.  I hope, the United Nations will play an effective role in this 
regard.  
Prolonged presence of the Rohingyas in Banglad esh has caused 
serious ramifications on the economy, environment, security, and socio -
political stability in Bangladesh. Uncertainty over repatriation has led to 
widespread frustration . Cross border organized crimes including human 
and drug trafficking are on the rise.  
This situation can potentially fuel radicalization. If the problem 
persists further, it may affect the security and stability of the entire region, 
and beyond.   
Mr. President,  
The greatest  lesson we learnt from  the Covid -19 pandemic is that 
‘no one is safe until everyone is  safe’. We must use the hard -earned 
lessons to stimulate critical and much needed reforms of our institutions, 
including of the United Nations, to better prepare for such calamities in 
the fut ure.Please check against delivery

 We are interested in looking for transformative solutions to poverty 
alleviation, mitigating adverse effects climate change, preventing 
conflicts and economic , energy and fuel crises that the world is grappling 
with now. However, we need to understan d the fact that socio -economic 
development cannot be achieved without ensuring peace and stability.  
We want the end of Russia -Ukraine war. Due to sanctions , and 
counter -sanctions, not a single country, rather the entire mankind 
including women and childre n is punished . Its impact does not remain 
confined to one  country, rather puts the lives and livelihoods of the people  
of all nations  in greater risk, and infringe s their human rights . People are 
deprived of food, shelter, healthcare and education. Children suffer the 
most in particular. Their future sinks into  darkness.  
My urge to the conscience of the  world  - stop the arms race, stop the 
war and sanctions .  Ensure food , education, healthcare  and security of the  
children. Establish  peace.  
We want to see a peaceful world with enhanced cooperation and 
solidarity, shared prosperity and collective actions. We share one planet, 
and we owe it to our future generations to leave it in a better shape.  
Mr. President,  
I would like to  talk about a cruel  tragedy.   
On 15 August 1975, my father, Father of the Nation, the incumbent  
President of Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was 
brutally assassinated , along with my  mother Sheikh Fazil atunnesa Mujib, 
my three  younger  brothers - Freedom Fighter Captain Sheikh Kamal, and 
his newly married wife Sultana, Freedom Fighter Lieutenant  Sheikh 
Jamal, his newly married wife Parveen Rosy, my 10-year old brother  
Sheikh Russell .Please check against delivery  
Page 12 of 13 
 Total 18 of my family members were killed including m y paternal 
uncle Freedom Fighter Sheikh Abu Naser,  paternal uncle Abdur Rab 
Serniabat , his 13 -year-old daughter Baby Serniabat, 10 -year old son Arif 
Serniabat, and 4 -year old  son Shukanto, my paternal cousin Freedom 
Fighter Sheikh Mani  and his pregnant wife Arzu Mani, Brigadier Jamil, 
Police Officer Siddiqur Rahman.  May their soul rest in peace.  
Only my younger sister, Sheikh Rehana and myself survived the 
brutality as we were in Germany  at that  time. After that, we spent 6 years 
abroad as refugees .  
In 1971, Pakistan occupation forces  killed three million innocent 
Bengalis. Two hundred th ousand women were  heinous ly torture d and 
abuse d. I recall their sacrifices with deep homage.  
After my father was arrested in 1971, he was taken to an undisclosed 
location in Pakistan. In Dhaka, my mother , my younger brother s Sheikh 
Russell and Sheikh Jamal, younger sister Sheikh Rehana and I were 
arrested , and we were kept  in a one -story damp house. My first child , 
Sajeeb Wazed Joy was born in that prison  house . No furniture was 
provided to us . There was no provisions for medical facilities . Even 
getting daily food was uncertain.  
So, myself as a sufferer, I can rightly realize the pain and agony that 
people endure due to the horrors of war, killings, coups and conflict s. 
Therefore, I do not want war, I want peace , I want welfa re for the 
humankind. I want economic development  for people. I want to ensure 
peaceful world, developed and prosperous life for future generations.  
My earnest appeal to you, ‘ stop war , stop arms  race’. May the values 
of humanity be upheld.Please check against delivery

77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  
Address of Mr Andrej Plenković  
Prime Minister of Croatia  
New York, 23 September 2022  
Excellencies,  
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Mister President (Csaba Kőrösi),  
We have gathered this year as a brutal war  with a multifaceted and 
global impact conti nues  to rage in Europe.  
The Russian aggression against Ukraine has upended the rules -based 
order , multilateral system and economic flows.  
It has brought about human suffering  and refugee  flows , destruction 
of civilian infrastructure and war crimes.  
The latest announcements about partial mobilisation in Russia, 
preparations for the organization for sham referenda in occupied parts of 
Ukraine and nuclear threats  are another dangerous escalation  in an 
already unprecedented crisis.  
While Ukrainian people  are suffering the most in their struggle to 
defend their homes, the consequences of the Russian aggression are 
felt globally  and so it must be condemned worldwide . 
Three decades ago, Croatia itself was a war -ravaged  country in 
jeopar dy, also facing armed aggression , almost a third of its territory 
was occupied .  
Additionally, we had to fight  for international  recognition  and were 
under an arms embargo. The Croatian people know  what it means to be under attack and what it 
takes to def end their homeland.  
Against all odds, Croatia and the Croatian  people prevailed .  
Many paid the highest price  for our freedom and liberty.  
Stronger for its own experience , Croatia today is an exporter of peace 
and stability , a humanitarian donor  worldwide , a popular tourist 
destination, and the country that produces the fastest electric car in the 
world.  
Success is possible, if one is determined  and has a vision of the 
future .  
Precisely because of our own experience, Croatia immediately and 
unequivocally  extended support  and solidarity  to Ukraine – political, 
humanitarian, economic and military.  
To do otherwise would be a betrayal of principles  and values we all 
hold dear, particularly respect for human rights and responsibility  to 
protect populations fr om atrocity crimes.  
This time around, Europe and its partners  came together to stand up to 
aggression, show solidarity and strengthen their own resilience .  
In October, we will highlight this unity  once  more in Zagreb, as Croatia 
prepares to host a first ever Parliamentary Summit  of the Crimea 
Platform.    
WITNESSING THE DEMOCRACY VS. AUTOCRACY DIVIDE  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
Croatia’s transition was long and complex, but it was guided by a firm 
notion that democracy , human rights and respect of national mino rities 
is the best way for Croatian society as a whole to further develop  and 
prosper . Today, our democratic systems are challenged  by the fallacious and 
dangerous thesis  that autocracy is ultimately a more efficient and a 
pragmatic  way to govern.  
Our national dialogues are distorted by targeted disinformation , fake 
news and hybrid attacks.  
Our trust in democracy is being undermined  from both within and from 
outside of our societies.  
As fierce as these challenges are, our commitment  to democracy, its  
procedures and values  must remain stronger.  
On the crossroad between democracy and autocracy , our choice 
should remain  clear.  
 
OUR COMMITMENT TO MULTILATERALISM AND RULES -BASED 
ORDER  
In today’s perilous moment, Croatia remains a staunch supporter  of 
the international rules -based order and the United Nations at the centre 
of global  cooperation.  
Far from being ideal, this system with all of its flaws has still enabled the 
world  to reach common ground and find some remarkable and 
inspirational resul ts for local and global issues  in the almost eight  
decades of its existence.  
We live in a plurality of simultaneous and  interconnected crises that 
affect us all.  
In order to overcome this perfect storm of crises , we need determined 
action now.  
First, further erosion of our core rules and values  should be halted 
and reversed, respect for international law upheld and accountability 
ensured. Second, we should act to make our system  fit for purpose.  
This is particularly true  for the reform of the UN Securi ty Council.  
The General Assembly intervened instead  and offered a platform for 
an overwhelming majority  of states to condemn the aggression  
against a sovereign  and independent country .  
When the world is facing a geopolitical crisis  of the scale such as t he 
one in Ukraine today, we must ensure that our policies and actions are 
predictable , reliable and timely across the UN system.  
Croatia’s adherence to promoting peace and security  is evident also 
by its continuous participation in the UN, EU and NATO peac ekeeping 
missions and operations.  
It is an investment we are readily willing  to make.  
ENSURING FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
As we were beginning to recover from COVID -19, the war in Ukraine 
has dramatically altered our perspectives and p olitical agenda.  
It radically changed not only the security , but also the energy 
architecture  of Europe and it is threatening global food security .  
We must stand united and step up our efforts in re -organizing the 
energy supply lines.  
We cannot accept ex tortion, and we cannot be held hostage over food 
and energy , which all of us need.  
We applaud the Secretary General and the UN  for their role in 
brokering the deal to export Ukrainian grain.  
On the regional level, Croatia is c ontributing to energy security and 
diversification by its liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal on the Adriatic 
island of Krk. Beyond ensuring its own needs , Croatia is now able to supply its 
neighbours and other countries in Central Europe.  
Simultaneousl y, Croatia is investing in renewable energy  with third of 
our energy consumption and almost half of our electricity production  
already coming from renewables.  
We are ensuring a fair transition and preventing energy  poverty , 
implementing financial measures  that benefit both the citizens and the 
business sector.  
We must find a global solution  to the price of gas, which threatens our 
households and our economies.  
It is intolerable for a minority of speculators  to enrich themselves in 
these times by imposing  exorbitant prices.  
What is more, we are also witnessing an intolerable  imbalance in 
terms of greenhouse  gas emissions : the richest 1% in the world are 
responsible for 15% of emissions, twice as much  as half the poorest of 
humanity.  
This is not acceptable . 
It is up to those who pollute the most  to provide the most effort: it is not 
only fair but also the most effective if we are to achieve our climate 
objectives.  
Clean mobility and innovative technologies  are an opportunity and 
new technologies such as hydrogen  offer  new horizons for stronger 
cooperation  between Europe, Africa and the Middle East.  
While we in Croatia successfully passed the test  during the pandemic 
and avoided social fracture  with tailored national measures, global 
inflation and the ris e of prices have to be tackled . We as a Government are continuing  our interventionist policy  to 
alleviate the burden of the energy crisis for our households and 
businesses, local governments and public institutions, schools and 
hospitals.  
Similar to our efforts during the pandemic, we are now implementing a 
strong national package  worth more than 6 percent of our GDP.  
This includes financial measures, subsidies for vulnerable groups and 
limiting prices of basic food items.  
AGENDA 2030 - CLIMATE CHANGE AND  BIODIVERSITY  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
Despite of enormous current challenges , we have a responsibility to 
also safeguard our commitments  to the Paris Agreement and the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development.  
Croatia welcomes the ambitious approach  put forw ard in the UN 
Secretary General’s report "" Our Common Agenda "" as a concrete 
roadmap towards its realization.  
Here too a revitalized global action  and political commitment is needed 
to ensure effective multilateralism .  
By integrating SDGs  in its National development strategy 2030, Croatia 
has proven its dedication to their full implementation.  
As a current member of ECOSOC , Croatia will work closely together 
with our partners to ensure more sustainable, greener, inclusive and 
equitable so cieties in which no one will be left behind .  
Ahead of the COP27  (27th UN Climate Change Conference) in Egypt , 
let us evaluate the implementation of our joint commitments  from 
Glasgow.  
We need to strengthen cooperation in the effort to find mechanisms and 
financial resources to fulfil the Paris Agreement and to continue the 
fight against climate change  on national, regional and global level.  
CROATIA AND EUROPE  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
In the year in which we are marking the 30th anniversary  of our UN 
member ship, Croatia remains constructive and responsible international 
actor.  
In the coming months, Croatia will join a group of only 15 other 
countries  which are at the same time members of EU, NATO, the 
Eurozone and the Schengen area.  
This follows a sober and  prudent decision in line with my Government’s 
policy of modern sovereignism.   
Through this policy, we have strengthened our international position by 
pooling resources  with our allies and partners, furthering our national 
interests  and tackling economic a nd social challenges.  
Croatia also pays special attention to Southeast Europe , a region still 
not fully integrated into the EU.  
This region’s stability, development and democratic  progress  is not 
only in our, but also in Europe’s interest.  
We support a clear EU perspective  for candidates and aspirants based 
on the fulfilment of well -established and clear criteria, the implementation 
of reforms and delivery of tangible results .  
The stability of neighbouring  Bosnia and Herzegovina , with which we  
share a thousand kilometres  long  border , is of particular importance  
for Croatia.  
We would like to see a prosperous and functional Bosnia and 
Herzegovina , progressing firmly on the path to EU membership. In light of the current situation  in Ukraine and elsewhere, it is pivotal 
that international law  and international treaties be respected.  
This includes in particular peace treaties  such as the Dayton -Paris 
Accords , which brought peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina as the 
multinational and multicultural home land of its three constitutive  
peoples —Croats, Bosniaks and Serbs .  
For the cohesion, stability and progress  of the country, their 
constitutional full equality  must be ensured and respected.  
Given the fact that the Bosniak political leaders  have publicly 
admitted  they had no true intention  to come to a deal over the electoral 
reform in line with the Constitutional Court verdict, the only way forward 
remains for the High Representative Christian Schmidt to act .  
As a friend of Bosnia and Herzegovina , I call upon  him to use  his 
powers to ensure legitimate representation and equality of Bosnian 
Croats  in the country’s institutions following the 2nd October  elections.  
As the least numerous  among the constituent peoples,  the Croats in 
Bosnia -Herzegovina demand no favours, only equality . 
 
CONCLUSION  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
We are mutually interdependent .  
Turmoil in one region has consequences  for us all.  
None of our national goals can be achieved without solidarity and the  
rules -based order , upon which not only our security, but also our 
survival rests .  
We must build, protect and defend , and stand up to those who destroy, 
lie and loot. As we witness aggression and atrocities  on European soil again and 
as the rule of power  threatens to bring the world order down, we owe it to 
future generations to be on the right side of history.  
The international community must foster its unity and stand with 
Ukraine  in the fight for its own existence.  
We have to unite in our respect of the international law,  as well as in 
finding global solutions  for solving overlapping crises, including rising 
inflation, energy and food crises.  
To achieve secure and affordable energy, we need a global solution  for 
the gas prices as well as to ensure su stainable energy transition.  
Our world has changed permanently.   
In these new circumstances, more international cooperation has no 
alternative.  
Let us commit to work jointly  to the benefit of our common future.  
Thank you.", HRV,2022

Statement by Honourable Fiame Naomi Mata’afa, Prime Minister of 
the Independent State of Samoa at The General Debate, 77th United 
Nations General Assembly, New York, 23 September 2022  
________________________________________________________________  
Mr President,  
Distinguished delegates,  
Ladies and Gentlemen.  
I extend Samoa’s congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Csaba Körösi 
on your assumption of the Presidency of the 77th Session of th e General 
Assembly . Please be assured of Samoa’s full support in the successful 
execution of your mandate over the next 12 months.  
Mr President,  
It is an honour for me to address this Assembly in -person as Samoa’s 
Prime Minister as part of the year long celebratory events of our 60th 
Independence anniversary since we  became independent in 1962 . 
Samoa has for decades championed the importance of the rule of law 
and protec tion of human rights . Many labelled the events that unfolded 
following our 2021 elections a constitutional crisis . While these were d ifficult 
times for Samoa, they were also key  to our forward  journey as a maturing 
democracy.  
It divided our country and te sted the key pillars of our society – our 
faith, our culture, and the rule of law. However, my delivering this statement 
today as the first female Prime Minister of Samoa and bringing about a 
change in government after four decades, are testament to the fa ct that thePage 2 of 14 
 rule of law has prevailed . Samoa today remains peaceful  and stable ; despite 
all the challenges we lived through . My gover nment will continue to 
safeguard the rights of all its citizens especially the most vulnerable , by 
strengthening appropriat e social protection measures and prioritising 
assistance for those, most in need . We have focused on people centred 
development as pivot al to the implementation of our development agenda  
over the next five years . 
Samoa presented its third Universal Periodi c Review in November 
2021. We maintain that our Christian values, unique culture,  and tr aditions 
complement our  human rights  obligations  and fundamental freedoms 
which we have  commit ted to promote, respect, protect and fulfil.  
Mr President , (SDGs)  
As we take stock of the global challenges  we face  we highlight the need 
for sustainable measures to address post -covid economic recovery, urge all 
nations to resolve and work towards peace and se curity, enhance resilience 
from climate change impacts, as well as achieving our Sustainable 
Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda . The theme of this year’s General 
Debate “ A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking 
challenges ” resonates with Samoa as we clearly recognise that  the world is 
at a critical moment in the history of the United Nations due to complex and 
interconnected crises . We need an effective United Nations to mobilize our 
collective efforts and to propel urgent actions to address these issues.Page 3 of 14 
 The achievement of the SDGs must be the driving force in our collective 
efforts over the next eight years . Together we must elevate our actions with 
urgency to address the climate emergency, or our planet will be lost to us 
and to future generations.  Though far removed from the centres of conflict, 
resultant escalating fuel and food prices  and threats of nuclear weapons use  
have reached our isolation. Yet no one empathises with the war,  climate is  
waging on atoll islanders watching their maritime boundaries disappear  fast 
with sea level rise.  
Samoa stands ready to meet  its obligations and commitments in achieving 
the SDGs . There is a need to strengthen capacity building at all levels, 
enhance data  and information collection and storage through national and 
regional climate change portals as well as  invest in robust  systems and 
processes, including reporting and verification, and knowledge brokerage .  
Improv ing resilience actions through learning and developing knowledge 
societies will enabl e adapt ation and responsiveness  to future crises.  
Mr President , (UN reforms)  
Both the global financial and governance systems are desperately in 
need of reform . As the UN Secretary -General lucidly puts it, the global 
financial system is morally bankrupt, and it favours the rich and punishes 
the poor . This must change . The approval and effective implementation of 
the multidimensional vulnerability index will be a move in the right 
direction in addressing this imb alance and make the global financial 
architecture fit for  purpose, by tackling the SIDS’  financing gaps . The full 
support of all our development partners, international financial institutionsPage 4 of 14 
 and multilateral development banks  is critical  in ensuring the e ffective 
implementation of the MVI.  
Mr President, (Vulnerabilities and MVI)  
Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face a unique set of 
vulnerabilities which impede their ability to achieve sustainable 
development.  The COVID -19 pandemic exacerbated those v ulnerabilities 
with many SIDS countries being particularly affected by the drop in 
international tourism and remittances. Consequently, the timely call for and 
endorsement of a multi -dimensional vulnerability index will allow for the 
inclusion of more than just income -based criteria to assess eligibility for 
concessional finance.  
A universal MVI could be viewed as the foundation upon which the 
key principles guiding specific responses to our vulnerabilities are anchored. 
It is an option and not a hindra nce. It should be perceived as the landing 
zone upon which specific responses could be framed depending on the 
circumstances involved .   It is a tool that provides for a richer lens on 
vulnerability and resilience  hence its  adoption and full imp lementation  is 
critical for our economic recovery.  
Mr President , (Climate Change)  
Climate change remains our number one priority. The scientific 
evidence is clear and irrefutable . For Pacific communities, the main 
challenge is securing action for survival, and we all need to shoulder our 
responsibilities and play our part. The big polluters and emitters have a 
moral obligation and responsibility to meet their commitments ahead ofPage 5 of 14 
 COP27 . Why ? Because t hey hold the key to our achieving the 1.5 -degree 
promise of the Paris Agreement . We call on all parties to commit to  more 
ambitious NDCs to meet the Paris Agreement promise  as we are all part of 
the solution.  
Our global commitment to implement the Paris Agreement is critical . Even 
with limiting warming t o 1.5 degrees SIDS will continue to incur severe loss 
and damage . We must therefore promote recovery investments that are 
climate smart , resilient, and in line with net zero emissions by 2050.  
We are at the doorstep of  COP27, we must work diligently to generate 
solutions to meet expectations . The achievement of a 50/50 split between 
mitigation and adaptation funding is of paramount importance to Samoa 
and SIDS . We should not put out the flame  for Loss and Damage .  
Natural disasters continue to devastate countless lives. Recent climate events 
are transboundary and drive  home the reality that no country is immune to 
the impacts of climate change . These environmental threats will worsen . The 
triple planetary crisis is t he alarm knell that is reminding us we are putting 
immeasurable pressure on the planet. Our relentl ess need to extract 
resources from nature is causing disruptions propelling  climate change, 
destroying nature, and raising pollution levels  
Any response prog rammes must be informed by our commitment to science 
for informed  policy; and law and institutions that strengthen environmental 
governance. We seek to further enable change through transformations in 
finance and economic systems; and by leveraging data an d technology for 
the environment. Small island developing states like Samoa do not alwaysPage 6 of 14 
 have the requisite levels of capabilities  and capacity to repurpose and 
redirect financial and economic systems towards sustainability, improve the 
effectiveness of l egal frameworks, deliver science as the catalyst for action  
and be digitally connected.  
Mr President , (Ocean s) 
The ocean  is in us and we are the ocean. It  is the lifeblood of our Blue Pacific 
nations – the lungs of our planet . But whilst its sustainable use provides a 
strategic pathway towards our sustainable development, we must also 
address the associated risks . The health of the ocean is a key priority 
challenge . We must therefore continue to advance work on the ocean -climate 
nexus  such as through  empowering women, girls and youth with relevant 
knowledge and skills to contribute to the health of the ocean .  
The recent Ocean Conference in Pa lau and the 2nd UN Oceans Conference in 
Lisbon were opportunities to take stock of the SDG14 and we welcome the 
call for more investment in making the ocean and its resources more 
sustainable . Of all the SDGs, Life below Water is the most under -funded . 
This must change . We need to attract and retain sustainable and innovative 
investment, including foreign direct investment through blending, 
guarantees and other innovative financial instruments .  
Our global community  must  focus on the work that remains to be  
accomplished . Pledges and commitments made at these two conferences and 
COP26 are inconsequential if they are not delivered on time to effect actions 
on the ground .Page 7 of 14 
 Samoa’s marine protection goals outline d in our first Ocean Strategy are  
aligned to the Blue Leaders 30 x 30 campaign, as well as  calls for protecting 
30% of our global oceans by 2030 . We welcome the complementarity of such 
initiativ es and encourage others to join . 
The Pacific Ocean hosts a remarkable array of biodiversity. With our Blue 
Pacific family, Samoa continues to prioritize both marine and terrestrial 
ecosystems’ restoration . We remain engaged in the Convention on the 
Biological Diversity process. Together with the UNFCCC COP27, 2022 is a 
critical year for aligning action to tackle the climate emergency, and 
addressing the threats posed by bio -diversity loss.  
The Pacific SIDS subscribe to the position that preserving maritime zones 
and the rights and entitlements that flow from them give   expression not 
only to the foundation principles of equity and stability, but also to the 
notion of climate justice deeply rooted in human rights and the principles of 
international law . In this vein we urge all member states to inject urgency 
into efforts to conclude ne gotiations on the BBNJ instrument.  Samoa pledges 
its support to the Vanuatu ICJ initiative  for an Advisory Opinion on climate 
change  
Mr President , (Plastics Pollution)  
We  must  unite to prevent and reduce marine pollution including plastics, 
oil spills, waste discharge and nuclear contaminants . If we continue down 
this current path, we will fish out of our oceans more plastics than fish . 
Pacific SIDS contribute less than 1.3 per  cent of the mismanaged plastics inPage 8 of 14 
 the world’s oceans yet are one of the main recipients of plastics pollution 
and its impacts .  
The effects of overfishing, and IUU fishing is a  major concern for Pacific 
economies . Lost revenues are in the billions . The i ncreased acidification of 
our ocean is already destroying entire reef ecosystems . Reef damage affects 
fish population which in turn affects enti re fisheries upon which we rely for 
our livelihoods  
Mr President,  (food security  and health ) 
The Global food system is at a critical stage made worse by the COVID -
19 pandemic, the onslaught of climate change, and the ongoing war in 
Ukraine. The Food Systems Summit held last year mobiliz ed the global 
community to find transformative solutions. Samoa was pleased to  be part 
of that important event which encouraged shared exploration of potentials 
for collective action.  
Through organized dialogues, Samoa benefited from a comprehensive 
assessment of the issues involved in building the sustainability of our food 
systems . Access to a balanced and nutritional diet i s crucial  and requires a 
return to locally produced quality fresh foods and less of processed 
imported foods. This will be key to addressing the rising burden of Non -
Communicable Diseases which represent the sin gle largest cause of 
premature mortality in the Pacific  countries  including Samoa .  With support  
from our  development partners , the Samoa government launched the first 
comprehensive NCD control program among Pacific Island countries, in 
May 2020 ; its aim is  to build people centered and systematic NCD servicePage 9 of 14 
 provision in Samoa to strengthen the  primary health care, empower  
communi ty participation, promote early detection and effective referral of 
NCDs, and increase population awareness of NCD risk factors.  
Mr President , (peace and security)  
We continue to call for a future of peaceful and open societies, free 
from wars, nuclear we apons, and the threat of terrorism.  
The Boe Declaration defines for the Pacific what constitutes security 
concerns . These are primarily non -conventional in nature  ranging f rom 
climate to environmental and resource security, human and cyber security,  
and transnational crimes . The 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific adopted by 
Forum Leaders at their July 2022 meeting will support and strengthen the 
key tenets of the Boe Declaration.  
While Samoa welcomes development partners on our terms, we note with 
concern the ongoing geopolitical posturing in our region and urge for our 
national and collective interests to be placed at the forefront, for a peaceful 
and secure Blue Pacific Continent .  
We are concerned about the serious shortfalls in the implementation of the 
Non -Proliferation Treaty  noting that  nuclear weapon states have spent 
billions of dollars on modernizing and maintaining their nuclear arsenals 
rather than spending on helping victims of past use and testing of nuclear 
weapons,  and focusing on achi eving sustainable development goals . The 
increasing use of ICT has raised issues of security and privacy. The online 
cyber -criminal activities have increased, including the dissemination and 
misuse of information.Page 10 of 14 
 We rely on our collective responsibility as a global community to prevent 
and combat high -tech cyber eand electronic crimes. Samoa believes these are 
crucial processes at the multilateral   in ensuring that cyberspace is safe for 
All. We therefore need to work together to combat and eliminate the se 
destabilising activities.  
Mr President , (SIDs  and Sustain able Development ) 
Accelerated action to meet the promise of the 2030 Agenda and its 
SDGs is an imperative . COVID -19 and climate change have uprooted and 
even reversed hard fought development gains. However, we must persist to 
meet the SDGs as they provide the best option  for a brighter future and 
countering the threats posed by the climate crisis.  
We should not  forget  the commitments and undertakings  made towards the 
full implementation of the SAMOA Pathway . I thank all SIDS partners, the 
Secretary –General for their continuous support and commitment to this 
task. The proposed monitoring framework for the SAMOA Pathway is a 
necessary tool for follow -up action and review  allowing for effective 
resource allocation and accountability . Outstanding issues relating to the 
framework  must  be concluded with urgency considering the fast -
approaching timeline set out in the Secretary –General’s report on this matter 
as well as the fast-approaching  timeline of the 20 24 SIDS conference.  
Mr President, (Economic Outlook)  
No country should be placed in a situation of choosing between rebuilding 
their economy and servicing their debt obligations . The March 2021 IMFPage 11 of 14 
 report noted that SIDS simply cannot support their SDGs and fund their core 
needs on their own  under the prevailing conditions of  economic contraction.  
Tourism may never return to pre -COVID -19 levels.  Aviation services will 
be slow to recover, and one casualty of the pandemic, in our case , was the 
recent demise of our national airline, Samoa Airways.  
Many Pacific Island countries rely on remittances from diasporas  and 
communities. Apart from being an important source of income for families 
and foreign exchange reserves for governments, remittances are an 
important buffer in periods of economic shocks and natural disasters. Yet 
the cost of sending remittances to the Pacific is over 10%  which  is higher than 
the global average and 7% higher than the target set by the SDGs .  
Mr President,  (Recovery  options) 
According to the 2021 IMF Report, the Pacific region is in a recession . 
Income, demand for regional exports, tourism receipts have all recorded 
reductions whilst public spending continues on an upward trajectory . The 
projected outcome is a greater risk of debt distress . It is also the case that 
most of the Pacific debts are wi th multilateral agencies . Whilst the adoption 
of austerity measures is an option, there is also the real possibility that this 
may worsen poverty and undermine  economic recovery .  
Multilateralism and united international cooperation are our best 
response t o the many threats we face and building resilience at the national 
level can only take us so far. Samoa is confident that despite all the 
challenges, even existential threats for some of us; there is still hope if therePage 12 of 14 
 is Unity amongst our UN family . We n eed to change our world for the better 
and leave hope for our future generations.  
Mr President , (Digitalisation)  
The COVID  19 situation, forcing border lockdowns and State of Emergency 
restrictions further emphasize the importance of digitalization for SIDS, to 
build resilience and meet the sustainable development goals.  
Samoa will continue to prioritize the need to invest in digital technologies 
and to promote a digital economy and connectivity . This is key to 
stimulating business opp ortunities and increasing productivity and growth 
in more traditional sectors such as agriculture and tourism . Investment in 
innovation and digitalization for Samoa, can enable more efficient delivery 
of health and education; improve connectivity between r ural and urban 
communities; advance economic empowerment for women and youth; and 
assist with more efficient public service delivery .  
To fully realize the benefits of a digital economy, Samoans must be able to 
connect with and trust the technology; an ena bling business environment 
must be in place, and investment in education, skills, and digital literacy is 
paramount. The availability of fast, reliable,  and affordable internet services 
to government, the business community and the public is crucial.  
In the agriculture and health sectors, we are investing in digital solutions for 
contact tracing and for information sharing between farmers. We recently 
launched our e -Health System to improve medical record keeping and 
strengthen health informati on and vital  statistics . More importantly, as we 
expect increasing health security threats, this e -Health System will be vitalPage 13 of 14 
 to protecting health and wellbeing and enhance the resilience of our 
population.  
 Our experiences with COVID 19 and ongoing fight with clima te change 
reinforces our conviction of the importance of technology and online 
distance learning to provide access to quality education for all.  
We should not lose sight of the fact that, while pursuing these home -grown 
solutions, we do not end up creating disparity between those who can and 
cannot access and afford these solutions. But I am convinced, that embracing 
technology and knowledge sharin g for our people, will be powerful drivers 
for change, innovation,  and welfare.  
Mr President , (Our Common agenda)  
Our Common Agenda highlights the urgency of reforming our global 
governance system . The coronavirus disease (COVID -19) is upending our 
world, threatening our health, destroying economies and livelihoods and 
deepening poverty and inequalities. Increasingly, people are turning their 
backs on the values of trust and solidarity in one another – the very values 
we need to rebuild our world and secure  a better, more sustainable future 
for our people and our planet. We agreed that our challenges are 
interconnected, across borders and all other divides  and can only be 
addressed by an equally interconnected response, through reinvigorated 
multilateralism and the United Nations at the centre of our efforts.  
Our Common Agenda  is, above all, an agenda of action designed to 
accelerate the implementation of existing agreements, including the 
Sustainable Development Goals  and is our road map to recapture thisPage 14 of 14 
 positive spirit and begin rebuilding our world and mending the trust in one 
another that is needed  at this moment in history.  
Like the Security Council and the global financial system, Samoa is 
convinced that now is the o pportune moment to bring about reforms that 
would make our global response to future crises and emergencies more 
effective, timely, and that an all -UN institutional approach is a necessity .  
Mr President,  
In conclusion, l et me end, by reaffirming Samoa’s commitment to the 
United Nations and our conviction that it remains the foremost forum to 
address all issues that transcend national boundaries.  
As we look to the future, the collective hope for humanity is for Leaders to  
take the tough decisions for the health of our planet . Entrenched positions 
devoid of today’s realities and in pursuit of unrelated agendas do not have 
a place in our collective efforts . While we  need to make  bold and courageous 
decisions, let us protect the safety nets crucial to our existence. There is a 
saying in my country that reads ‘aua le naunau ile I’a ae maumau ai le upega’ 
which translates to ‘hunger not for the fish at the risk of ruining your net.

Dritan Abazović, PhD  
General debate of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly  
New York, September 23rd 2022  
 
 
Mr. Chairman,  
Secretary General,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
 
It is my exceptional  pleasure to address you today on behalf of Montenegro and to 
reaffirm and reiterate our strong, unequivocal support and commitment to the goals and 
principles, as well as the overall mission of the World Organization – the champion of 
multilateralism - particularly in these troubling times.    
 
I would like to start by expressing our support for the election of Csaba Kőrösi (Čaba 
Korosi) as Chairman of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and 
wishing him success in performing this chall enging and demanding duty. I assure you, 
Your Excellency, of the full support of the Montenegrin delegation during Your venture.  
 
Likewise, allow me to extend our cordial gratitude to his predecessor, Abdulla Shahid 
(Abdula Šahid), for his impressive leade rship and guidance in creating the neccesary 
preconditions towards the fulfillment of the General Assembly mandate during the 
corona virus pandemic, but through other burdensome circumstances.  
 
Mr. Chairman,  
We commend your choice of this year's General De bate topic, as precisely a dillema 
which should and will dominate our attention in the days ahead. An adequate reaction to 
the multidimensional consequences of the still ongoing pandemic, as well as unilateral 
behaviour of certain international actors, in order to achieve a sustainable and peacefull 
future, must have our full attention, the strongest of wills and resources. It is clear, 
however, what is the conditio sine qua non  a peacefull and prosperous global society – 
multilateralism at its best and strongest, along with a more powerfull role of the United 
Nations, which must be at the epicenter of international cooperation and global 
response. Indeed, the United Nations were  created in order to offer solutions to 
challenges and to maintain international peace and security, standing behind what was 
achieved in San Francisco, so many years ago. Nevertheless, recent geopolitical 
develompents have clearly demonstrated that our ef forts have fallen short – we can andmust do more – not just more, but also better, if we are to preserve the rule based 
international order, as we know it.   
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
The ongoing geopolitical crisis represents the gravest chall enge for international peace 
and security since the creation of the World Organization. The unprovoked and 
unjustified Russian aggression against Ukraine, in addition to already existing turnmoils 
throughout the world, only adding to critical issues such a s COVID -19 and climate 
change, plainly indicate the need to fully return to the provisions of the UN Charter, 
respect for its binding character and the universality of its goals and principles – 
civilizational values on which the rule based world order r ests. We have to understand - 
the violation of territorial integrity and sovereignty of any state is a threat to all, which 
cannot and must not be tolerated.  
 
The Russian aggression against Ukraine has resulted in almost total material 
devastation, human c asulties and suffering on a large scale, which is why it must end 
immediately. The world ought to be united as ever before in defending democracy, 
human rights, the rule of law and ensuring peace and prosperity – but above all, 
preserving human lives. In t his context, I would like to reaffirm Montenegro's clear -cut 
position in condemning Russian aggression and warmongering, and our support for the 
territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized 
borders.  
 
Russia's unju stified and unprovoked aggression against Ukraine poses not only a 
pressing threat to the rule -based international order, but to the global economy and food 
security, with far -reaching negative effects on all countries. We are facing yet a new 
crisis, espe cially in departments of basic foodstuffs, energy and finance, with the 
consequences of the Russian aggression taking its toll especially on those belonging to 
the most sensitive and vulnerable categories. The risks of social unrest and instability 
have in creased significantly, making it necessary to demonstrate solidarity and unity, in 
the form of a revitalised and much stronger multilateralism, if we are to adequately 
address the existing negative impacts and prevent future crisis in a timely manner.  
 
This kind of brutal use of force requires an immediate and an appropriate response. We 
call on the international community  to vocally and continually express its condemnation 
and denunciation of this unprovoked act of warmongering, attacks on civilians, crit ical 
infrastructure and human rights violations. The onslaught we are witnessing represents 
a blatant and audacious violation of international humanitarian law and international 
human rights law, for which we seek and demand accountability.In light of the  aforementioned, Montenegro strongly supports the UN Secretary 
General's report ""Our Common Future"" - a historic opportunity to modernize and reform 
the global governance system, with a strengthened UN at the center of inclusive and 
empowered multilaterali sm. The Report comes at a critical juncture, when the world 
order as we know it is being jeopardized, and with Russia's aggression against Ukraine 
highlighting major deficiencies in the global governance system.  
In the conditions of increase in violence a nd the threat of use of force around the world, 
it is high time we define a new and a more effective approach to peace and security, 
based on human rights and the fundamental principles of international law. Continuous 
violations of the UN Charter and inte rnational law, along with a culture of impunity and, 
concretely, in this case - Russia's ability to impede an effective response by the Security 
Council – illustrate the urgency of improving the means at our disposal in addressing 
the ever rising regional and global challenges. In view of these circumstances, we call 
for the Security Council, as the guardian of international peace and security, to be 
reformed in such a manner that it can fulfill its mandate in terms of getting to grips with 
growing unilater al behaviour, geopolitical tensions and rivalries. A step in the right 
direction would be a permanent mandate of the Security Council, which would make it 
possible to convene a session of the Council in conditions where a veto has been 
previously imposed. Futhermore, Montenegro also supports the banning of the use of 
veto in the Security Council in cases of massive human rights violations.  
 
We very much welcome the initiative of the UN Secretary General to define a ""New 
Agenda for Peace"", with a stronger fo cus on prevention, through full implementation of 
diplomatic measures by the UN Secretary General, including the strengthening of 
capacities for mediation. Montenegro is firmly committed and determined to actively and 
constructively contribute and support collective efforts to preserve world peace and 
security. We strongly advocate for the role and work of the UN peacekeeping missions, 
which, nonetheless, must be more efficient and effective, their actions aligned with the 
Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) agen da and the A4P+ implementation plan, and guided 
by viable political strategies in order to contribute to the improvement of political 
solutions to conflicts, all based on respect for human rights and freedoms. Our political 
commitment to peacekeeping opera tions and their effective mandate, especially in the 
area of civilian protection, was once again confirmed through the support for the 
Secretary General's Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) and the A4P+ implementation plan.  
 
The new agenda for peace will requ ire stronger cooperation on prevention and fight 
against terrorism, violent extremism, transnational crime, trafficking, hybrid attacks 
which include the instrumentalization of migrants and refugees, as well as cyber 
attacks. In addressing these challenges , our actions must be fully aligned withinternational law and international human rights law, along with a strong commitment to 
disarmament, non -proliferation and arms control. Responding after the outbreak of a 
conflict or crisis is often not enough, or not timely enough. It is in this domain precisely 
that we must pay more attention to prevention – prevention of conflict, radicalization and 
violent extremism. In order to achieve such a goal, it is necessary to work on building 
fairer and more inclusive s ocieties which will offer equal opportunities for all, and to 
protect marginalized and most vulnerable groups, primarily women and youth.  
 
The multilateral disarmament, non -proliferation and arms control architecture is being 
tested by Russia's aggression against Ukraine as we speak, dictating the need for its 
strengthening in order to prevent further deterioration of the global security envi ronment.  
 
Montenegro is devotedly committed to the fortifying, full implementation and 
universalization of the multilateral regime for disarmament and non -proliferation, and to 
that extent, the promotion of the universalization and full implementation of t he Non 
Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Montenegro continues to be a responsible and reliable agent 
in efforts to achieve sustainable peace and security, which presupposes collective and 
focused action of the international community. Guided by that postulate, w e actively 
participated in the last month's 10th Review Conference of the NPT, representing the 
very foundation of the global non -proliferation regime. In this changed, significantly 
compromised perspective of the global security regime, fueled by the unju stified and 
unprovoked act of aggression of the Russian Federation towards Ukraine, it is of 
paramount importance to reaffirm international norms related to the non -proliferation of 
nuclear weapons, considering the potentialy catastrophic consequences of n uclear 
incidents for people and the environment. In this regard, the situation at the Zaporozhye 
nuclear power plant is of great concern to us, which is why we underline the importance 
of allowing unhindered access to the IAEA experts to this and other nuc lear power 
plants in Ukraine, in order to ensure compliance with IAEA safeguards and the 
application of the verification regime in all nuclear reactors. The prerequisite for getting 
back on track to control nuclear power plants in Ukraine however, is for t he Russian 
Federation to return control of the nuclear facilities to the Ukrainian authorities.  
 
Montenegro will continue to support multilateral instruments in the field of chemical and 
biological weapons, with the aim of preserving the international ban  on their use and 
eradicating the culture of impunity for the use of these type of weapons. Along these 
lines, and of no less importance, we remind on the necessity for supporting the 
application and strengthening of instruments and regimes in the field of  conventional 
arms control.Efforts to preserve peace and security are closely related to the ability to address other 
global challenges – eradicating poverty, reducing inequality and injustice, addressing 
the climate crisis, biodiversity loss and ecolog ical degradation, promoting global health, 
gender equality, universal social protection and decent work for everyone, respect for 
human rights, democratic principles and the promotion of the rule of law and 
responsibility.  
 
With the COVID -19 pandemic still  ongoing, the achievement of sustainable 
development goals is very much in doubt, while the triple planetary crisis and the impact 
of Russian aggression on all parts of the globe indicate the need to strengthen 
resistance to future shocks and ensure a sust ainable, fair and inclusive recovery. The 
increase in global food insecurity and malnutrition are loud reminders of the need to 
create sustainable food systems and achieve climate resilience, especially in the most 
vulnerable parts of the world. Russia's a ggression has brought instability and an 
increased risk of fragmentation of the international community, with ever intensifying 
severe socioeconomic consequences of the conflict. Food insecurity, limited access to 
energy and rare raw materials due to trade  disruptions, as well as macroeconomic 
consequences such as high inflation and rising debt levels affect many countries around 
the world, making it virtually impossible to achieve our common goal of building a better 
world by 2030.  
  
The commitment of the Government of Montenegro to the systemic and strategic 
internalization of the concept of sustainable development, the achievement of 
sustainable development goals and the implementation of Agenda 2030 is unequivocal 
and, as such, represents one of the pivo tal principles of our work. We are proud of the 
fact that Montenegro is one of the first countries to integrate Agenda 2030 into its 
national normative framework, more than six years ago, by adopting the National 
Strategy for Sustainable Development until 2030, along with the Action Plan for its 
implementation. All 17 goals and 169 tasks of Agenda 2030 are systematically and 
institutionally treated through the implementation of defined economic and social 
policies, aimed at generating economic progress, eve nly developing all parts of our 
country, preserving our natural habitat and enabling the prosperity of all citizens, based 
on the truly transformative ""leave no one behind"" principle.  
 
Montenegro's position in the context of sustainable development is also  strategically 
reflected in our foreign policy actions. Along these lines, as a member of the UN 
Economic and Social Council for the period 2020 -2022, we actively contribute to the 
additional improvement of the actions and activities of the UN in this doma in, and we 
remain a responsible and reliable partner in joint efforts to keep a set of the most 
relevant economic, social, humanitarian and environmental topics high on the UNagenda. We are particularly proud to point out the fact that at the recently hel d 
High -Level Political Forum, in July, here in New York, Montenegro presented its Second 
Voluntary National Report regarding the achievement of the Sustainable Development 
Goals, thereby introducing the results and challenges our country faces in the conte xt 
sustainable development policy. With this, we once again demonstrated our firm 
intention to jointly build our communities based on the principles of sustainable 
development, convinced that sharing good practices and lessons learned in this area 
represen ts the most effective way forward. The presentation of the Voluntary National 
Review, for the first time after six years, is an important experience for Montenegrin 
society, and the analysis, in addition to the presentation of what was done previously, 
also maps important segments that ought to be paid attention to in the following period 
in order to stay on track of sustainable development.  
 
The triple planetary crisis I mentioned previously - climate change, loss of biodiversity 
and pollution - represents  an existential threat to people and the planet and must be 
urgently addressed since it threatens sustainable development, deepens existing 
vulnerabilities, and the realization of human rights and global peace. The latest report 
by the Intergovernmental Pa nel on Climate Change warns of the irreversible impacts of 
global warming, noting that climate change could soon overwhelm our and nature's 
ability to adapt – unless we reduce emissions quickly.  
 
The international community needs to do significantly better  in the fight against climate 
change, which has cataclysmic, often irreversible effects on our environment. 
Montenegro, to the extent of its influence on these processes, responsibly contributes to 
the control and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Alt hough our country has a very 
small greenhouse gas emission per capita (0.009% of the global level), we are taking 
important and bold steps to promote post -pandemic recovery based on green 
development and the use of ecologically clean technologies.  
 
We are  particularly proud to point out that we have achieved the set goal of reducing the 
emission of gases that cause the greenhouse effect by 30% (compared to the reference 
year 1990) - already in 2018. Encouraged by this success, the next goal is to reduce th e 
emission of these gases by 45% through new activities in the area of improving 
industrial technologies, implementing energy efficiency measures and increasing the 
share of energy originating from renewable sources. The most significant investments in 
the Montenegrin economy in the previous multi -year period were precisely in the field of 
energy, and today we are investing significant efforts in further improving program 
budgeting and improving the coordination of international funding sources. Along the se 
lines, in order to allocate additional financial resources for the continuation of the energytransition, Montenegro continues to cooperate with international climate funds, such as 
the Global Environmental Facility, the Green Climate Fund and the Adapt ation Fund.  
 
Respect, protection and exercise of rights are the basis of a free, prosperous and a 
sustainable society. As a member of the Human Rights Council for the period 
2022 -2024, Montenegro will continue to strongly promote and defend the indivisibil ity 
and universality of human rights, gender equality, democracy, good governance, the rule 
of law and the fight against corruption. Aware of the importance of the activities of civil 
society and human rights defenders, we will tirelesly advocate for incre asing the space 
for their unhindered activities. Additionally, we will support the UN Secretary -General's 
new vision for the rule of law that places people at the center of the justice system. 
Indicating our commitment to equality and non -discrimination, w e will continue to fight 
against discrimination on any basis.  
 
In relation to the full enjoyment of the rights of women and girls, we emphasize the need 
for stronger prevention and eradication of all forms of sexual and gender -based 
violence. In an increas ingly unstable world, which is particularly conditioned by violence 
and conflicts, the protection of civilians, including women and children in armed 
conflicts, is a byproduct of the activities of Montenegro, especially as a member of the 
Human Rights Coun cil. We also highlight the importance of addressing new challenges 
for human rights, such as hybrid threats, technological development, climate change 
and environmental degradation, and the intense consequences of the COVID -19 
pandemic.  
 
Transitional justi ce and accountability for serious violations of human rights and 
international humanitarian law, especially through the operation of the International 
Criminal Court, must be strengthened, especially bearing in mind the war suffering in 
Ukraine. In this co ntext, we call on transferred support to the ICC, full respect of 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law, and provision of 
unhindered access of humanitarian aid to the affected population. We need to work on f 
eradicating the cul ture of impunity for committed crimes, and seek and demand 
accountability for which has been done.  
 
The COVID -19 pandemic has highlighted gaps in the world's ability to respond quickly 
to global health crises and highlighted the need for a stronger and mor e inclusive global 
health architecture, with the World Health Organization at the center. A key lesson 
learned from the pandemic is that the current multilateral framework for global health is 
outdated and that we need to invest significantly more in globa l health security capacity 
to be better prepared for the future. In addition to fighting the current pandemic and 
vaccinating the population, while ensuring timely, affordable and equal global access tovaccines, the ultimate goal remains improving univers al health coverage and building 
strong and resilient health systems in all countries. Montenegro will therefore support 
negotiations on a legally binding convention, agreement or other international 
instrument to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparednes s and response within the 
World Health Organization.  
 
Excelencies,  
 
Montenegro, proud of its century's old multiethnic and multiconfessional tradition,  
remains steadfast on the course of a Euro -Atlantic future, good neighborly relations and 
multilateralism. We are on our way of becoming a part of the European community -  
which needs to include the entire Western Balkans region - because we are, and always 
were - Europe.  
 
We are resolutely and continuously adopting and implementing reforms in various 
spheres, all with the aim of improving the quality of life and creating a state tailored to 
the needs of a man. Being a geographical part of Europe, as well as values and 
principles wise, we are convinced that only acceleration of integration processes and a 
stronger incentive of our EU partners can be a barrier to the maligna nt influence of third 
parties. Promoting and investing in stability and prosperity of the Region is, 
undoubtedly, an important asset and contribution to the overall security and stability of 
Europe.  
 
At a time when we are witnessing a negative trend of str engthened unilateralism and 
protectionism, and increasing deviation from multilateralism, Montenegro has no 
dilemma. Even more motivated and more determined, we remain unwaverly committed 
and devoted to international unity, based on universal values and principles of the UN 
Charter, with a World Organization capable of providing an adequate response to global 
crisis, challenges and threats.  
 
To conclude, dear colleagues,  
 
We are at a crossroad in history, as so many times before. And, as so many times 
before, I am certain that we will only come out stronger. The very core principles of 
international law that the United Nations stand for are being not just threatened, but 
essentially nullified. We cannot act as innocent standbys and quietly watch as this is  
happening in Ukraine. We must rise to the challenge, raise our voice and stand up for 
those in need, and show that these principles are not subject to interpretation and 
relativization, but that those who violate these principles must be held accountable.I would like to use this grand stage  to once again call on Russia to stop its hostilities in 
Ukraine, unconditionally withdraw its army from the Ukrainian territory and return official 
Kiev control over the occupied areas. Please, stop this needless war . Too many people 
have already lost their lives. Too many people have had their homes destroyed, and 
forced to flee their country. This must not happen in the 22nd century. This can not be a 
heritage we leave for the future generations. We need to give pea ce a chance.    
 
I thank you for your attention.", MNE,2022

 Statement To the 77  
General Assembly of the United Nations  
By 
The Hon. Dr. Terrance Drew  
Prime Minister  
Of 
St Kitts and Nevis  
 
 
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, Distinguished Delegates  
 
I congratulate you on  your election as President of the General 
Assembly of this august body.  
 
I also  pause to salute your predecessor in office, His Excellency, 
Abdulla Shahid, the Foreign Minister of the Maldives  for his sterling 
tenure .    
  
I recognized The Secretary Gene ral, Mr. Antonio Guterres,  for his 
outstanding steward ship over the past few years .  
 
Mr. President,  
 
It is indeed an honour  for me to address this body for the first time 
since assuming the role of Prime Minister just 44 days ago. I bring 
 you greetings from the Government and people of Saint Kitts and 
Nevis  and pledge our unswerving support to the ethos of this body . 
 
I have a ssumed my new responsibilities when the complexities of 
the multiple and interlocking challenges facing humanity that 
require from us a renewed commitment to the democratic principle 
and to multilateralism.  
 
It is clear to me that the tectonic plates of g eopolitics and global 
stability are shifting beneath us.  
 
What are those tectonic shifts?  
 
▪ It is now certain knowledge that a pathogen can emerge with 
such lethal power, that it threatens, the very survival of 
mankind.  
 
▪ The coincidence in timing of a global pandemic and a war, 
with the growing calamity of the climate crisis, has exposed 
the frag ility, vulnerability and instability of the global supply 
chains for food, staples and other essentials.  
 
▪ Power shifts are taking place in international relations, as the 
influence of some countries rises and others wanes. With this 
has come an insistence  for reform of the United Nations to 
 make it more relevant and reflective of the composition of 
today’s world and current power structures, including reform 
of the anachronistic Security Council . 
 
▪ The effect and ubiquitous nature of technology is creating 
change faster than most can  manage it . 
 
▪ Faith in the multilateral system is being eroded, and its 
capacity to do global good, is being jeopardized by the rise in 
crass, unbridled nationalism which has shown  the powerful 
to be nonchalant  to the suffering of anyone other than their 
own population.   
 
The State of Multilateral Cooperation  
 
It was the seventh Secretary General , His Excellency  Kofi Annan, 
who reminded us that, “no nation can defend itself against the 
threats to development entirely on its own;” that “the challenges 
we face are global,  and they demand a global response.” This 
remains true today!  
 
COVID -19 with all its consequences has presented us with a 
powerful reminder that we are all connected ,  which compels every 
nation and every person to be their brothers’ and sisters’ keepers . 
 Mr. President,  
 
The United Nations finds itself at a crossroads in our reckoning with 
history’s judgment. Do we want to be the body that abdicated our 
responsibility  to protect the planet? Or the body that debates and 
postures as the world around us submerges beneath cascading 
crises? It is my hope that we choose instead to be the body that 
met the moment and responded to the fierce urgency of now.  
 
We must therefore  use this 77th General Assembly - not merely for 
political posturing - but for resolute recommitment to multilateral 
cooperation. For Small Island Developing States, and indeed 
vulnerable peoples everywhere there can  be no 
international security without cl imate security . This requires 
collective fidelity to multilateral action for our very survival.  
 
I am ready and I am sure that all of us are eager to build a better 
world through multilateral action , and uphold , with all our will and 
might , this sacred tenet of the United Nations .  Even as geopolitics 
and great power competition is exacerbating conflict and the 
climate catastrophe, we must face the hard truth that only through 
multilateralism will we force the global trajectory toward global 
peace, prosperity and sustainability. 
  
Climate Action and Security:  
 
Mr. President ,  
 
Every country on the planet, national populations have had to 
confront the reality of climate change. As our planet heats up, so 
too have the frustrations and impatience of the globe’s ordinary 
citizens, who feel they are losing the fight to make ends meet and 
secure the future of their children.  
 
Small island developing states and other developing nations 
experience a reality, plagued by this continuous existential 
threat.    With the passage of every hurricane, every outbreak of 
war and every global food shorta ge, we all remain at risk of tipping 
the balance that we have striven to create over the years.  
 
Thus, it is not enough for  us to articulate this grim reality year after 
year.  We must now look to act  in ways that provide tailored 
responses to these vulnerabilities so as to foster true resilience and 
risk mitigation.   Therefore I humbly urge  countries to  honor the 
financial commitments made following the COP26 to double 
contributions to adaptation fina ncing by 2025. A delayed response 
to these commitments would further imperil our developing 
nations. Climate financing, resiliency and environmental 
 conservation must be integrated into national development policies 
and must be at the forefront of our glob al development agenda.  
 
Multi -Dimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI):  
 
Mr. President,  
 
This situation cries out for the multilateral system to urgently put 
in place a multidimensional vulnerability index which takes into 
consideration the peculiar characte ristics and climate 
vulnerabilities of small island developing states such as mine .  
 
Mr. President ,  
 
All countries are environmentally vulnerable; all are socially and 
economically exposed to exogenous shock, but  in the climate -
challenged,  tourism -dependent countries in the Caribbean Sea, 
during several consecutive months of every year,  run the real risk 
of a wipe out event . Surely this warrants special consideration.  
 
Caribbean nations are on the “bullet end” of a cli mate fight we did 
not cause, do not want, and cannot afford, but are unable to 
escape. 
 I, therefore join my brothers and sister leaders in CARICOM in 
calling for  the development of a multidimensional vulnerability 
index (MVI). Therefore,  Saint Kitts and N evis will use this index in 
its advocacy for a more appropriate redistribution of development 
assistance and access to concessional financing.  
 
Education and Transformation Education Summit  
 
Mr. President ,  
 
Notwithstanding this  injustice we continue to invest i n social 
empowerment programs in order to build resilience in our people 
and economy.  One such area is   education  which is one  
 
of society’s greatest equalizers. Saint Kitts and Nevis reaffirms 
that access to quality education is a human right and the 
foundation of sustainable development and thriving societies.  
 
We welcome the Transforming Education Summit that was held 
earlier t his week and I am happy to report that our government 
has committed to entering a new pact, A New Deal  on Education 
as it were, that will reform, transform and re -invigorate our 
education system based on equality, access and inclusion.  In fact, 
just a few  weeks ago, my government made a decision to 
 introduce free tertiary education to ensure that all people can 
have equal access regardless of their socio -economic status.  
 
Other goals for educational reforms include, but are not limited to  
 
1. Incorporating ST EAM specialist spaces in all schools;  
2. Reintroducing  the i -Literacy one -to-one laptop programme;  
3. Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education by 
providing alternative programming and scholarships.  
 
Youth and Women Empowerment  
 
Mr. President,   
 
As part of my government’s thrust to mainstream empowerment 
across all sectors and policies, Saint Kitts and Nevis will continue 
to put women and youth at the forefront of our social 
development and all our pursuits including the advancem ent of 
the digital economy. We are confident our active inclusion of 
women and youth in public life through their appointment in our 
parliament, diplomatic and senior civil service and other decision -
making fora; will bear much fruit.  
 
Therefore it is aga inst this backdrop that we pledge our support 
to the ongoing process of the Declaration of Future Generations 
 that will culminate in the Summit of the Future next year. And 
pledge as its leader,  my country’s  active commitment to 
meeting goal 5 of the SDG  and surpassing the goals of Belem De 
Para in achieving gender equity now and for future generations.  
   
Partnerships  
 
The recent past has proven that we cannot ignore the glaring 
truth of our interconnectedness as nations in the international 
community.   The world continues to shrink in size, drawing us all 
nearer to each other as a people, reinforcing the need for global 
solidarity, international cooperation, and strong and meaningful 
partnerships.    
 
Taiwan  
 
Mr. President,  
 
We are stronger in the company of our friends, particularly those 
which share our democratic principles and values!   In this body of 
nations, I re -emphasize our unswerving support for Taiwan’s 
meaningful participation in the UN system. Taiwan has been a 
long-standing friend and a partner for sustainable development.  
Their unfailing commitment in this regard since the very day of 
 my country’s independence is consistent with the spirit and intent 
of Goal 17 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  
 
Mr. President,  
 
I can speak  first-hand to what our friendship with the Republic of 
Cuba and what it means to me and its value to the people of 
Saint Kitts and Nevis. Cuba has partnered with my own country 
and many in the developing world in healthcare, education, 
training and agricu lture. We call for an end to the decades long 
embargo imposed against Cuba.  
 
My country encourages meaningful dialogue in resolving these 
and other conflicts in countries that are targeted by unfair 
sanctions that create enduring external and internal hard ships.   
 
In closing Mr. President,  
 
We must be bold and grand in the way we forge forward with a 
promise to leave no one behind . My government and I are 
prepared to do our utmost for our people,  which would be 
enhanced by multilateralism and the United Nations should afford 
to this opportunity to  all.  
 
The theme for this year’s General Assembly was well chosen. 
 The idea of watershed speaks to significant and transformational 
change. The challenges faced by the countries of the world and 
their p eople, are indeed interlocking and we must resolve them 
together. The issue for us is, how we will bring that change about 
for those who most need it.  
 
Mr. President, I am obliged to you.", KNA,2022

AT THE  
 
 
GENERAL DEBATE  
OF THE  
SEVENTY -SEVENTH  SESSION OF  
THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FRIDAY, 23  SEPTEMBER 2022                           PLEASE CHECK AGAINST DELIVERYMr President,  
 
I take this podium with a heavy heart. More pessimistic than I was last year. More cynical 
and disappointed.  
 
We have come to depend on the multilateral system that ha s at its centre the Charter of this 
our United Nations.  
 
Where is the collective will to adequately address the challenges of our time? Where is our 
shared conviction to work together for the betterment of mankind? Where is the hope?  
 
Today there are confl icts on several continents; geopolitical tensions are heightened.  
 
The unjustified, unprovoked and illegal attack on Ukraine by the Russian Federation has 
shaken the foundations of the multilateral  system.  
 
This is wrong!  
 
The consequential crises we fac e are not confined to the battlefield in Europe; they are 
global and affect us all.  
 
Democratic norms and human rights, even where thought to be firmly rooted, are being 
rolled back.  Poverty is on the increase. The planet is being destroyed by climate cha nge. 
And international cooperation and solidarity have been supplanted by nationalism and 
unilateralism.  
 
Global market prices for food and petroleum remain volatile, reaching historic highs earlier 
this year.   
The lingering impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic and persistent supply chain disruptions 
have contributed to sky rocketing inflation.  
 
These economic realities exacerbate an already acute social situation in Belize. Poverty is 
estimated to have risen by 10%  between 2018 and 2021. 45.5% of Belizeans are estimated 
to be moderately to severely food insecure. And homicides are again on the rise.  
 
The post pandemic recovery we anticipated is delayed. And the chorus of promises and 
commitments to pivot toward buil ding back better, to getting the recovery right have 
yielded little. Instead, global action and inaction have only resulted in deepening the many 
crises that we are facing.  
 
Global temperatures have already increased by 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre - indu strial 
levels. Greenhouse gas emissions reached record highs in 2021 and continue to rise this 
year.Fossil fuels are still dominant; while renewables account for an abysmal 15% of global 
energy sources.  
 
The current energy crisis in Europe has triggere d more fossil fuels as a panacea, rather 
than a doubling down on energy transition.  
 
Biodiversity is declining at a faster rate than ever before with profound and unknown 
consequences for our environment, health, productivity and wellbeing.  
 
These realitie s heighten climate risk, especially for vulnerable states. Belize is ranked 8th 
out of 183 on the Global Climate Risk Index. We are but one hurricane away from 
catastrophe.  
Yet financing needed for climate adaptation remains woefully inadequate; only about  a 
quarter of all climate finance goes to adaptation.  
 
Global debt is at crisis levels.  
 
The Secretary General’s latest report on the Sustainable Development Goals paints a dismal 
and disturbing picture of the state of play of the achievement of Agenda 2 030.  The SDGs 
are at real risk of not being achieved.  
Our current systems and institutions, conceived for World War II recovery, are straining 
under the weight of today’s crises.  
 
In truth, they are broken and stand impotent in the face of the 3Cs - covid, climate, and 
conflict. And, yes, our people and our planet are paying the price.  
 
How do we fix this?  
 
We need a full scale, bold reimagining of the global financial architecture. No more 
tinkering at the edges to conceive of additional programmes tha t are based on the same 
false logic. It just doesn’t work!  
 
Mr President,  
 
Public sector expenditure on climate -caused “loss and damage” cannot continue to be 
classified according to fiscal orthodoxy. The IMF is largely devoid of ways to quantify 
consequential climate impacts on public debt and countries’ capacity to pay.  
 
The I FI’s obstinate focus on primary balances and debt to GDP ratios ignores the empirical 
evidence that nature is in revolt. Incredibly, a recent analysis revealed that of the 80 IMF -
funded Country Programs around the world, climate was central to the country assessment 
in only a single case – Samoa.  
 
We need a new global financial architecture that has the willingness and capacity to 
identify systemic threats like debt, like climate risk and devise tools that are commensurate 
to the challenge.We urgently n eed a new global financial architecture, dedicated to achieving the SDGs, net 
zero emissions and to build resilience.  
 
We need a new global financial architecture that incorporates an effective global financial 
safety net with the capacity to respond to today’s multiple, simultaneous and escalating 
crises.  
We need a global financial architecture for today’s challenges, that is responsive to the 
needs of states today, especially the vulnerable countries — many of which were not 
member states in 1940s.   
 
Belize has within our limited fiscal space, tried to stimulate an economic recovery, while 
staying true to our social values.  
 
The Belizean economy grew by 5.3% in the first quarter of this year; the highest level of 
production for any first qua rter on record.  
 
Through an innovative debt for nature swap, Belize reduced its debt to GDP ratio from 
133% to 108% last year — resulting in over $250 million in debt service savings.  
 
My government has instituted an amnesty programme to enable those who q ualify, up to 
40,000 persons, to be regularized.  
 
We anticipate that by the end of the amnesty we would have regularized more migrants, 
per capita, than any other country.  
 
But forces at global level are determined to diminish our aspiration for our econo mic 
rebound, to underwrite our social and human development and resilience.  
 
Three critical issues must be addressed by a new global financial architecture to achieve 
transformative and systemic solutions:  
 
The financing needs of developing countries have  increased significantly since we adopted 
Agenda 2030.  
 
IFIs and MDBs have failed to meet the needs of developing countries. The figures don’t lie. 
The truth is that the financing needs of developing countries is $4.3 trillion — more than 
quadruple the lending capacity of the IMF; and well above the lending trends of the World 
Bank, which loaned only $99 billion last year.  
 
The availability of affordable, long term and dependable sources of financing is 
indispensable for the achievement of the SDGs and climate resilience.  
 
We need IFIs that will urgently align their policies and practices with the achievement of 
the SDGs and climate goals and redistribute liquidity to developing countries. We need a 
long overdue expansion in quota allocatio ns to expand the resources of the IMF.We need MDBs and regional banks to provide considerably more longer -term financing, de -
risk investment, support the development of capital markets, and integrate sustainability 
objectives to enable the use of innova tive instruments.  
 
Financing must be accessible and affordable for vulnerable countries.  
 
Amazingly, in the last 7 years financial flows to SIDS have declined. Net ODA declined from 
$6.2 billion in 2016 to $4.1 billion in 2018.  
 
The paradox is that the c ountries most vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters, 
and with the least fiscal capacity to adapt and recover , do not qualify for grant and 
concessionary financing.  
 
And this paradox is magnified when you consider that since 2008, G20 nations have 
printed $25 trillion in stimulus money.   
 
We therefore, call on IFIs, MDBs and development partners to use the Multidimensional 
Vulnerability Index after its finalization later this year. This will unlock financing for 
vulnerable countries, supportin g their efforts to achieve the SDGs, adapt to climate change 
and build resilience.  
 
Public debt is at unprecedented levels globally. It has surpassed the 2008 financial crises 
levels. Commercial banks and private investors hold about $54 trillion in global  sovereign 
debts of emerging markets. This debt deluge is attributable to: inaccessibility of 
concessional financing, impact of the pandemic, costs of climate change and disaster 
recovery and other external shocks — and for SIDS, structural features relate d to small 
size.  
 
The current tentative, reactionary and piecemeal approach to addressing the debt problem 
has proven hopelessly ineffective.  
 
We must break the pernicious cycle between debt and climate and disaster risk. IFIs must 
incorporate climate ris k into debt sustainability tools.  
 
We need a two -prong response. One, debt relief is needed for all vulnerable countries. And 
two we need to rapidly mainstream innovative policies which tackle debt repayment 
capacity and avoid excessive indebtedness.  
 
In the current circumstances, there is a compelling urgency to advance a multilateral 
sovereign debt restructuring mechanism.Mr President,  
 
History, a cruel history, is repeating itself. For centuries, colonialism transported trillions in 
plundered wealth to the oppressors. Reparations are overdue. And now I ask, how much 
longer will this new “climate colonialism” punish the victims and spare the victimizers?  
 
Speaking of injustices, it is shameful that a unilateral, illegal and immoral com mercial and 
financial embargo continues to be imposed on Cuba in defiance of the international 
community and UN resolutions.  
 
The cruel sanctions visited on the Cuban people were not eased as they suffered the wrath 
of the COVID -19 pandemic. Even now, as the effects of the fires in Matanzas cause hardship, 
there appears to be no possibility of easing. Belize repeats our call for the immediate lifting 
of the embargo and we salute the resilience and fortitude of the Cuban people.  
 Estamos con ustedes.  
 
Belize continues to be gravely concerned about the spiraling deterioration of the situation 
in Haiti. We call on the international community to advance a robust and comprehensive 
programme of support for the Haitian people.  
 
Mr. President, Taiwan , an exemplar y nation in many respects, continues to be excluded 
from the international community, unable to participate and contribute to functional 
multilateral cooperation. The challenges confronting mankind today require the full 
participation of all countries and peoples in the struggle for development and prosperity. 
The outdated policy imposed on Taiwan to promote its exclusion must yield to the greater 
good. Belize calls for Taiwan to take its rightful place among the international community 
of nations.  
 
I also  reiterate Belize’s full support for the realisation of an independent Palestinian state, 
within its 1967 borders, with all attendant rights, including the recognition of East 
Jerusalem as its capital and the right of return.  The people of Palestine contin ue to suffer 
the indignities of illegal occupation and apartheid. The disturbing prospect that the world’s 
sacred promise to deliver a two -state solution is slipping from their grasp.  
 
Mr President,  
 
Justice is the cornerstone of peace. And in that spiri t, Belize and Guatemala have been 
pursuing the peaceful, just and final resolution of Guatemala’s Claim to Belizean territory 
before the International Court of Justice.  
 
We continue to count on the support of the international community as the judicial pr ocess 
proceeds, and when it concludes, for the demarcation exercise to be carried out. In the 
meantime, we must redouble our efforts to manage the daily challenges which arise along 
the border areas in accordance with the 2005 Confidence Building Measures.  Additionally, 
now more than ever we need to conclude a Sarstoon Protocol, a cooperation mechanism, to 
avoid unnecessary incidents in that area.We had great expectations for COP26 in Glasgow. COP26 was considered a “make or break” 
moment for the world’s leaders to make more ambitious pledges to keep 1.5 degrees 
Celsius within reach.  
 
We were wrong!  
 
Rather than getting global commitments to keep 1.5 alive, we left Glasgow with 
commitments that will see global temperature increase by 2.7o Celsius by 2100. This is 
utterly unacceptable and morally unjust.  
Our people will continue to suffer for something we did not cause.  
 
Rather than meeting their commitments to deliver 100 billion dollars annually, we left 
Glasgow with a finance roadmap. Ye t another paper promise.  
 
Rather than delivering a Loss and Damage Facility to help our countries deal with the 
losses and damages caused by climate change, we left with mas palabras!  In the meantime, 
Belize continues to suffer from climate -related damag es equivalent to 4% of its GDP 
annually, among the highest in the world.  
 
Let’s try this again. Less talk and more decisions at the next two COPs.  
 
COP 15 in Montreal must agree an ambitious and effective post -2020 Global Biodiversity 
Framework, to take a ccount of the economic costs of biodiversity and provide financial 
support to developing countries efforts to deter biodiversity loss.  
 
At COP27 in Egypt, the G20 must bring new commitments to close the emissions gap; bring 
the financing for adaptation and establish a financing facility to substantively address loss 
and damage. We are extremely concerned that these expectations may be jeopardized by 
G20 dynamics. But we cannot allow backsliding.  
 
Anything less is a failure.  
 
For Belize and SI DS, failure is not an option.  
 
The COVID -19 pandemic, and the climate emergency, are the most catastrophic events 
since World War II.  
 
Then as now, new vision, frameworks, and instruments are required to achieve a 
sustainable and inclusive future which o ur people and future generations deserve.  
 
The near term global economic outlook compels us to act with urgency to avert even worse 
humanitarian and development outcomes and to restore stability to the international 
system.Mr President, Excellencies, l adies and gentlemen.  
 
Our failure to act decisively and urgently on covid, conflicts and climate  condemns 
humanity and our planet irreversibly to disaster. History will not absolve us if we fail.  Our 
collective destiny and future inspire us to action.  
 
The aspirations of our people must be fulfilled. We know what to do. We have the resources 
to meet the needs of mankind.  
 
We must find the political will to act.  
 
We must act now to avert disaster  and to fulfill  the promise of tomorrow. We ask for the 
guidance of our creator so that our work is not in vain.  
 
I thank you.", BLZ,2022

UNGA7 7 Theme:   
 
“A Watershed Moment:  Transformative solutions to Inter -locking Challenges” 
 Introduction  
Mr. President, Distinguished members of the General Assembly, Ladies and Gentlemen,  
1 On behalf of the Government of Tuvalu, I congratulate you on your election as President of the 
77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Tuvalu has full confidence in your leadership. Let 
me also take this opportunity to thank the president of our 7 6th session, Hon. Minister Abdulla  Shahid, for 
a very su ccessful session under his leadershi p, despite the challenges  due to the covid19 pandemic.  
 
Theme of UNGA77: “A watershed moment: transformative solution to interlocking challenges”.  
Mr. President  
2 We welcome the pragmatic vision of  your presidency of the 77th Session of the UN General 
Assembly.  We applaud  you for  the theme of your presidency: “A watershed moment: transformative 
solution s to interlocking challenges.”  Indeed,  we must  strengthen our commitment to upholding the core 
principles of the UN Charter  at this watershed moment .  We maintain ed that the UN Charter is our  shared 
Constitutive Instrument to maintain ing international peace and security, developing friendly relations 
among nation s, and promoting social progress, better living standards  and human rights.  
3 We are indeed encouraged by the priorities of your presidency, and we look forward to working 
closely with you  as we continue to grapple with economic recovery from the covid 19 pandemic, tackle 
climate change, and strive to  achieve  the S ustainable Development Goals.  
 
Mr. President 
 4 Global crises have become more complex, interlinked, and transboundary in th eir impacts , 
demanding  global cooperation and solidarity to  formulate and implement  sustainable solutions.   It requires 
all the partnerships we need to  bring about positive changes  to people’s lives.  
It is however regrettable that the Republic of China (Taiwan), with its notable  partnership s on a wide range 
of development issues , continues to be kept out of the U nited Nations system.   Tuvalu has significantly 
benefitted from  our partnership s in agriculture, food security, public health, medicine, clean energy , 
including our recovery  from the economic and social impacts of the Covid19 pandemic.  
5 Tuvalu strongly supports the readmission  of the Republic of China (Taiwan)  into the UN as a 
founding member of the U nited Nation s, and its active participation in UN specialized agencies including 
the World Health Organization, the Inte rnational Civil Aviation Organization, and the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change.   We must not sideline  Taiwan , a vibrant democracy  that has 
made significant  progress on all the Sustainable Development Goals, and ready to contribute  more to global 
efforts in achieving the SDGs.  
6 It is also regrettable that the people of Cuba continued to face the economic burden of the long 
unilateral economic blockade .   The economic blockade neglected the human rights and the spirit of 
cooperation espoused in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Deve lopment .  Keeping these measures in place 
deprived Cuba of the international development assistance and partnerships to recover and build back better.  
 
Mr. President  
7 In the same vein, we reiterated the strong concerns of our region  of the potential thre at of nuclear 
contamination to the health  and security of the Blue Pacific, its people  and prospects, and reaffirmed the 
importance of ensuring international consultations , international law, and independent and verifiable 
scientific assessments .  These principles  must govern the deployment  and use of nuclear technology, and 
the discharge of nuclear  materials  and wastes  into our Blue Pacific Continent. 
 8 We maintained that the UN decolonization process is critical to the protection of human rights 
including the right to self-determination  and urge the meaningful engageme nt of the UN with all relevant 
partners and stakeholders to the decolonization process.    
 
Mr. President  
9 Let me now speak of an issue that is of the greatest  concern to my country.   Climate change and its 
consequential sea level rise, remains the single greatest existential threat my country faces, underscoring 
the urgency to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees through rapid, deep, and sustained reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions.  
10 At an average land elevation of no more than 2 meters above sea level, m y country will succumb 
to sea level rise.  The IPCC report issued last year is clea r, that at current global warming trend, we are 
destined to miss the 1.5  degrees target of the Paris Agreement.  This clearly means  that Tuvalu will be 
totally submerged within this century.   
 
Mr. President  
11 The climate crisis is creating an increasingly uncertain future for people in most parts of the  world. 
Paradoxically in my region, the Pacific, it is making our future increasingly certain: but  not in a way that 
gives us any kind of comfort.  
12 During this century, several Pacific Island nations will become mostly uninhabitable.  For my  
country Tuvalu, which sits halfway between Hawaii and Australia, this could happen in  the next  two to 
three decades. Other Pacific Island countries on the climate change frontline may have a  few decades 
longer; but our final destination  is no longer a matter of guesswork.   Most societies see climate change as 
mainly about cutting carbon emissions or mitigating future  impacts.   We are facing a looming situation far 
 more profound - the near certainty of terminal  inundation.  Our peoples, in my generation or the next, will 
be unable to exist on the islands that  have nurtured our ances tors for centuries  – it is our God -given home.  
 
Mr. President  
13 Tuvalu and our Pacific neighbours have done nothing to cause climate change.  Carbon  emissions 
combined across the entirety of Pacific Islands amount to less than 0.03% of the  world’s total – even less 
if we speak of historical emissions. The existential threat we face is not  of our making.  But it will remake 
us. 
14 How we will negotiate this remaking is a question that the international community must now  
urgently begin to address.   Major economies  which have the highest contribution to greenhouse gas 
emission cannot be oblivious and do nothing.  
15 People everywhere, across all ages and walks of life, are demanding leadership on climate  change, 
especially from those most able to provid e it.  Tuvalu is an acid test of leadership:  because if the 
international community allows an entire country to disappear from climate  change, what hope will be 
possible for anyone else?  
 
Mr. President  
16 These are u nprecedented times . Science cannot tell us exactly when our homeland will become 
uninhabitable.   But it does tell us  how.   As the ocean rises, salt water permeates into the aquifers that provide 
our drinking water .  Now , in many places, our water security is severely compromised.  A rising ocean 
brings higher tides, and with increasing storm frequency and intensity, our villages , and agriculture  are 
devastated .  Flooding leaves soil saline, reducing crop yields , severely compromising our food security . 
 Infrastructure  such as homes, ro ads, and power lines are washed away; and higher land on which to rebuild  
does not exist.  
 
Mr. President  
17 The precious coral that supports our tourism and nurtures our fish -stock perish, as the ocean  warms 
and acidifies.  The cost of eking out an existence, of maintaining the status quo, increases  for individuals 
and the entire country, over time becoming too much to bear.  Such extrem ities push citizens to leave; the 
nation itself becomes increasingly inchoate, legally,  and spiritually  rooted to a  shoreline that is disappearing 
under rising tides.  
18 This is how a Pacific atoll dies. This is how our islands will cease to exist.   This is not about some 
future  scenario .  It is what we are living with now!  
 
Mr. President  
19 Inaction brings responsibilities .  Tuvalu have not yet reached the end of this process of salination, 
destruction, degradation, and  demise.  But we are well past the beginning.   Despite international agreements 
and repeated commitments, global greenhouse gas emissions  continue to rise, with many countries still 
pursuing a future fueled  by coal, oil, and gas.  
20 This is the first time in history that the collective action of many nations – or more accurately,  the 
collective inaction of many nations will be responsible for making sovereign countries  uninhabitable.  It is 
an unprecedented crisis requiring radical intervention.  
 
Mr. President 
 21 Current international instruments such as the Convention on Stateless ness do not cover  our 
situation. Neither does the United Nations’ various efforts to address climate change.   Agreements reached  
at its annual summits, including last year’s COP26 in Glasgow, cover a  wide range of issues like targets for 
cutting emissions or commitments for international finance  to address impacts.  But with regard the looming  
uninhabitability of sovereign states, they say  NOTHING . 
  
Mr. President  
22 This is why  Tuvalu,  and the Marshall Islands  launched the Rising Nations  Initiative  yesterday to 
fill the current gaps in  awareness, legal framework and political commitment.   The global community must 
begin a serious and responsible dialogue that acknowledges both the  realities and the rights of Pacific Island 
nations such as mine, and more fundamentally, of our  citizens.  
 
Mr. President  
23  This is about Sovereignty,  Dignity,  and Integrity . 
We need a global settlement that guarantees nation states such as Tuvalu  and the  Marshall Islands a 
permanent existence beyond the inhabitable lifetime of our atoll homes , irrespective of the onslaught of 
climate change and sea level rise.   It must recognize  and protect our cultural integrity, our human and 
economic capital, and our  sovereignty.   It must be co -created and enacted wit h the peoples and governments 
of Island  nations, not visited upon us by others.  
 
Mr. President 
 24 This settlement includes, ultimately, the protection of our rights to our land and ocean, preserve our 
heritage, and sovereign right to govern our citizens.  our relocation elsewhere in the world where our 
peoples  will be welcome and celebrated.   We do not  seek to move out of our homeland.  We seek fair and 
amicable treatment  of displaced peopl e so we do not become  a burden on others; but equally, natural justice 
dictates that we are not fobbed off with  a wasteland.   Economically, we can continue to support ourselves 
– in the case of Tuvalu, for  example, using income from the continued sustainable use of the Exclusive 
Economic Zone  around our islands.  
25 Finding the right solution will require statesmanship and empath y, beginning with an  
acknowledgement that a situation globally caused must also have a globally just and equitable  solution.  
 
Mr. President  
26 As Pacific peoples, we raise our children to respect the ocean, land, and sky, as providers of life.  
Now, through no fault of our own, we will soon have to abandon the oceans, land,  and sky that  have forged 
our cultures and identities  for cent uries .  We neither castigate nor demand charity.  But we do ask  for 
generosity of spirit, support, and justice tha t recognizes our reality  and our grave concern  on the potential

Debate of the 77th Session of the United Nations General 
Assemb ly 
23 September 2022  
### 
Mr. President,  
Mr. Secretary -General,  
Distinguished delegates , 
 
I congratulat e His Excellency Csaba Kőrösi  on his assumption of the 
Presidency of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.  
 
Mr. President, you take stewardship of th is assembly in extraordinary 
times.  Not since 1945 ha ve we  witness ed the international agenda grow 
in scale so drastically . So relentlessly.  
 
As conflicts  grow , as the climate  crisis rages, as economies lie in 
shambles, as we emerge from an era -defining pandemic, we  are left 
anxious and fearful . 
 
Yet, we cannot retreat or linger in despair .    
 
Instead, this moment should make us reflect on the kind of world we want  
going forward . How can we make it more resilient? More just?   
 
Mr. President,  
 
The Maldives proposes five main areas of focus.  
 
First, we need to address the raging climate crisis .  
 
This crisis remains an existential threat , especially to SIDS .-2- 
 
 
 
For us, the difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is death.  
 
 
Internationally, the Maldives will continue to lead the way in climate 
action.  In doing so, we  will continue to advocate for a rights -based 
approach .  
 
In 2008, the Maldives and other like -minded countries pursued Human 
Rights Council resolution 7/23, on human rights and climate change .  
 
After decades of advocacy  at the Human Rights Council and the General 
Assembly, in July this year, we celebrated in th is Hall, the adoption of the  
landmark resolution , recognizing  the “Human Right to a clean healthy, 
and sustainable environment” .  
 
We are once again, c ompeting for a seat on the Human Rights Council for 
the term running 2023 to 2025. If elected, addressing climate change as 
an integral part of the global human rights discourse , will be among our 
priorities. We hope to have your support for our candidatur e.    
 
The Maldives will also set a national example.  Like other SIDS, we only 
make a miniscule  contribution to global carbon emissions. We will be the 
first to bear the consequences.  
 
And yet, we are the ones with some of the most ambitious climate action 
targets.  
 
We are pursuing an ambitious national plan to reach net zero by 2030, a 
goal we can only meet with international support.   
 
This year, we launched the Glasgow -Sharm El -Sheikh Work Programme 
on the Global Goal on Adaptation in the Maldives, with a view to support 
global action.-3- 
 
 
 
I urge the global community – let us do more!   
 
We must act before it is too late.  
 
We also urgently need to protect  our ocean.  
 
The Maldives is a large ocean State. Our lives and livelihoods, our culture 
and traditions are linked  to the ocean.  
 
This is why we support the global initiative to protect thirty percent of the 
world’s oceans by 2030. Nationally, w e have been working to protect our 
EEZ. We have now designated seventy -nine marine -protected areas, 
including fourteen percent of our coral reefs.  
 
Considering the damage caused by plastic s to maritime ecosystems, we 
have also implemented a ban on the imp ortation, production, and sale of 
several types of single -use plastic s. And we  have set a national target to 
fully phase out single -use plastic s by 2030.   
 
Excellencies – we only have one planet . Protecting  it is our only choice if 
we care about our contin ued survival.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Second, we need sustainable, and reliable sources of financing.  
 
In 2009 in Copenhagen , an ambitious pledge was made, that 100 -billion  
in climate financing would be mobilized by 2020. Even in 2022, we are 
far short of meeting that pledge . Partners  must  scale up their efforts  to 
make up the difference .  
 
And we urge our partners to redouble adaptation finance as agreed under 
the Glasgow Climate Pact in 2021.-4- 
 
 
 
It is also important to make access easier for all, especially developing 
countries.  
 
 
We know that the world can mobili ze resources when required. We know 
we have the finances. But we need to direct them. We need to make 
assessment s for that financing fairer.  
 
This is why, we have always been staunch supporters of alternative 
measures to GDP.  
 
Traditional measures of development fail to accurately capture the 
vulnerabilities of countries and their resilience against  external shocks.  
 
In this context, w e look forward to the  finalization of the Multi -
dimensional Vulnerability Index by the end of the year, and its swift 
utilization.  
 
Mr. President  
 
Third, we need gender equality to be at the forefront of our agenda.  
 
For centuries  women have had their contributions undervalued and their 
voices discounted.   
 
This injustice  cannot continue . We cannot solve the challenges facing all 
of humanity while half of humanity is denied their full potential.  
 
Women deserve an equal seat at the table .  
 
The Maldives is advancing many legislative and executive initiatives to 
advance women’s representation.  The Government has passed legislation 
to allocate 33 percent of our local council seats to women. We have-5- 
 
 
appointed women as Supreme Court Justices for the first time. Half of our 
ambassadors are women.  
 
Despite progress, much remains to  be done. W omen con tinue to face  a 
variety of challenges – including  misogyny and  gender -based violence.   
 
We can and  must  do better.  
 
 
Mr. President,  
 
Fourth, i t is vital  the world comes together to solve the peace and 
security challenges we face . 
 
We need to work harder to stop conflicts and the flagrant violations of 
international norms  undermining the multilateral system we have 
painstakingly built in the past 77 years.   
 
The people of  Ukraine , Afghanistan , Myanmar, among other  countries  
plunged into conflict and bloodshed, deserve peace. They deserve an end 
to the ongoing tragedies upending their lives.   
 
As do the people of Palestine. The Maldives reiterates that a two -state 
solution based on the pre -1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital 
of Palestine, is the only meaningful  solution for a lasting peace .  
 
Address ing terrorism should also be a priority. Its menace  continues to 
plague our world  and jeopardizes  the safety and cohesion of our societ ies.  
 
The Maldives condemns terrorism in all its forms  and will work with the 
international community  to comprehensively combat both  terrorism and 
violent  ideologies .  
 
Mr President,-6- 
 
 
 
The issues  of our time are complex and multifaceted . We cannot apply 
old solutions to new challenges .    
 
Which brings me to my fifth and final point. It is vital that we reform 
the multilateral system  and better equip  the United Nations to meet 
contemporary and future challenges.  What we need is a UN 2.0.  
 
This is the thrust of the Secretary General’s Report “Our Common 
Agenda”.  
 
We wholeheartedly welcome  the recent adoption of a resolution to 
establish the UN Youth Office by consensus, carrying forward one of the 
OCA’s most important recommendations.  
 
We agree with the underlying spirit of that resolution. We cannot continue 
to deny the voices of  the 1.8 billion young people , especially on decisions 
that impact their futures.  
 
The Maldives will constructively engage with Member States to continue 
the follow up process to the OCA report .  
 
Mr. President . 
 
Another critical aspect of re vitalizing  the United Nations  should be 
reforming the Security  Council , a goal the Maldives has advocated for 
decades.  
 
We have  consistently  called to increas e the number of both permanent and 
non-permanent seats , while  ensuring equitable geographic representation , 
to make the Council more responsive and responsible.  
 
We also support increasing the substantial role and moral authority of the 
General Assembly. A welcome decision in this regard, is the recen t-7- 
 
 
adoption of the veto initiative  – a resolution Maldives was happy to 
support.  
 
Mr. President , 
 
The Maldives  has always believed that our small size should not diminish 
our standing in the international arena.  
 
We believe that a rules -based international order, where all states have a 
voice, and are fairly represented  and included , is necessary .  
 
It is our hope that our ongoing efforts at multilateral reform culminates in 
such an outcome.  
 
Mr. President ,  
Mr. Secretary General , 
 
These extraordinary times we face  must be met with  extraordinary  
courage . With extraordinary vision. With extraordinary  ambition, and  
extraordinary leadership .  
 
As we look ahead , the tasks before us may seem daunting. They are 
immense  in scale and borderless in their dimensions.  
 
They are beyond the capacity of any country to address by ourselves.   
 
But together we can meet these challenges.  
 
Together, we have the resources, the power,  the imagination to usher in a 
brighter future  for humanity .  
 
The Maldives will continue to work alongside  our peer nations in the 
international community to deliver  that vision .-8- 
 
 
Together, we can.  
 
Thank you.", MDV,2022

H.E. Ms.  Penny Wong  
Minister for Foreign Affairs  
to the UN General Assembly  
New York  
23 September 2022 
 
President, it is my honour to speak on behalf of Australia in this venerated General 
Assembly Hall  that signifies so much to the world’s peoples.  
This remains the only place where the whole world has agreed to come together – 
Recognising that we can only solve our biggest problems together – 
Recognising that progress and development are preconditions f or peace – 
Recognising that to avoid conflict, we must talk to each other – and we must listen to 
each other.  
It is my honour to speak on behalf of a country that is home to people from more than 
300 different ancestries and to the oldest continuous cultur e on the planet.  
Like this hall, Australia is an assembly of the world’s peoples.  
When Australians look out to the world, we see ourselves reflected in it.  
Equally, the world can see itself reflected in Australia.  
A nation whose people share common ground with so many of the world’s peoples.  
A nation where half our people were born overseas or have a parent born overseas.I am one of those people.  
And the Australian Parliament I serve in is ever more reflective of our modern nation, 
both enriched by their d iversity.  
This follows the collective decision of the Australian people to turn the page and write a 
new future for themselves.  
Newly elected parliamentarians have origins from across the world, and Indigenous 
Australians have been elected in record number s - and serve in the Ministry in record 
numbers.  
The new Australian Government is determined to make real progress on the national 
journey of healing with Indigenous Australians, the First Peoples of our continent.  
As Foreign Minister, I am determined to see First Nations perspectives at the heart of 
Australian foreign policy, and this week I have been encouraged by discussions with 
other countries on their own journeys.  
I am humbled to be guided in these efforts by First Nations colleagues. Here in New 
York I am joined by Senator Patrick Dodson.  
To many Australians, Senator Dodson is the Father of Reconciliation.  
Senator Dodson is a Yawuru man from Broome, in the remote north-west of Australia.  
Like many First Nations people, he walks in two worlds: as a Senator and leader in our 
Parliament; and as an elder, native title holder and ceremony man for his people.  
In our Government, Senator Dodson has been tasked with responding to a call from 
First Nations people for a constitutionally enshrined Voice to the Australian Parliament, 
as well as treaty and truth -telling.  
With daunting challenges facing the world, we have much to learn from First Nations 
peoples – both at home and in international fora.  
Elevating First Nations voices – including right here – has ne ver been more important.  
Our nation’s history and present show that like anything human, indeed like this 
institution in which we gather, we are not perfect.  
But we aim ever higher. And we look to make our contribution to the world.Australians see our country as it is, we see the world as it is, and we seek to shape them 
for the better.  
Sharing common ground with so many of the world’s peoples means Australians want 
to see the interests of all the world’s peoples upheld, along with our own.  
This aim of tod ay’s Australia accords with the ambition of an Australian who helped 
shape the UN’s Charter, our former foreign minister and the third President of this 
General Assembly, Dr Herbert Evatt.  
At the 1945 San Francisco Conference where the Charter was written,  Evatt challenged 
the great powers. They wanted a strong Security Council that had control over the 
General Assembly.  
Dr Evatt did not succeed in his fight against the great powers’ veto within the Security 
Council, but he did succeed in ensuring that the General Assembly has the ability to 
decide its own course, and can address any matter that falls within the UN Charter or 
the powers and functions of any of its organs.  
He understood that small and medium countries cannot simply allow their fates to be 
decided by the great powers.  
He understood that small and medium countries must be able to maintain their 
sovereign choices, protected by a stable framework of rules.  
And he understood that in order to maintain those sovereign choices, the small and 
medium co untries of the world, including Australia, must work together.  
These are legacies we renew today.  
Dr Evatt also saw economic and social security as the precondition for peace.  
He pressed the San Francisco Conference to ensure the UN addresses the broadest 
range of social, economic and human rights issues, saying:  
“Real stability… can only be achieved by building an organisation that will do its utmost 
to assure the peoples of the world a full opportunity in living in freedom from want as 
well as in freedom from external aggression.”  
Some didn’t want to extend the UN’s ambit to economic and social development. On 
behalf of Australia, Evatt insisted.And again, these are legacies Australia renews today.  
Despite inheriting the biggest debt in our nation’s history, the new Australian 
Government is determined to play its part in supporting the development of other 
nations – particularly in our region.  
We are alarmed that for the first time, the UN’s Human Development Index has declined 
for two consecutive years, i n 2020 and 2021.  
The impact of this decline has been most severe on women and girls, with nearly half a 
billion women and girls now living in extreme poverty.  
And the global food security crisis is increasingly grave. More than 800 million people 
go to bed hungry every night. 345 million people face acute food insecurity. 50 million 
people across 45 countries are on the brink of famine.  
This is a growing scale of human suffering that threatens untold global instability.  
Australia is increasing our contribut ion to development assistance by over a billion 
dollars.  
If we are ever to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, which represent our 
collective vision for minimum living standards for everyone living on this planet, every 
country needs to do more.  
Over the coming months, we are designing a new development policy, outlining how we 
will play our part in a world in an era of crisis – and how we will help developing 
countries without driving them into unsustainable debt.  
The world has experienced disast ers and conflict in the past. But the intensity and 
confluence of today’s challenges in an interconnected world are without precedent.  
COVID -19 has set back development gains.  
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has unleashed further suffering and made it harder for 
populations to recover from the pandemic.  
Drought and potential famine in the Horn of Africa. Major floods in Pakistan. Record -
breaking heatwaves in Europe and Asia. The alarm bells of climate change growing 
louder, including in my own country.Austral ians are clear that they want urgent and serious action, and they have given their 
Government a mandate.  
Among the first acts of the new Australian Government has been to submit our 
ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations Framewo rk 
Convention on Climate Change, and we have just passed legislation that makes these 
targets law.  
Our climate policies mean that within this decade, 83 per cent of Australia’s energy 
supply will be renewable.  
We want to help the global energy transition. Australia will be a renewable energy 
superpower.  
And while we are playing our part to reduce our own emissions, we are working in our 
region to support Pacific countries which have the most to lose from the changing 
climate.  
Nothing is more central to the security and economies of the Pacific than climate 
change. As Pacific leaders themselves put it plainly in the first article of the 2018 Pacific 
Island Forum’s Boe Declaration on Regional Security:  
We reaffirm that climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, 
security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific and our commitment to progress 
the implementation of the Paris Agreement.  
Australians are part of the Pacific family.  
Families are about care, love and forgiveness. But they are also about duty and loyalty, 
looking out for each other, and listening to each other.  
The Australian people want to be better, more involved, and more helpful members of 
the Pacific family.  
In my first months as Foreign Minister, I have visited six Pac ific Islands Forum countries.  
It is a clear sign of our priorities that by the end of this year I will have visited nearly all 
of them.  
Australians want to enhance our defence, maritime and economic cooperation with 
Pacific Island Countries. And we want to  be the Pacific’s partner of choice for 
development and security.We are increasing our development assistance to the Pacific by over half a billion 
dollars.  
We are working with our Pacific partners to address our shared challenges and 
implement the 2050 S trategy for the Blue Pacific.  
And we want to bridge our cooperation across the Pacific and Southeast Asia, to 
address shared challenges, and to build the region we want.  
Australia seeks deeper engagement with Southeast Asia.  
It is a region I know well. It is the region I am from.  
The region is being reshaped, and Australia seeks to work with our partners in ASEAN to 
shape this period of change together.  
Australia seeks a region that is peaceful and predictable, that is governed by accepted 
rules and norms, where all our countries and peoples can cooperate, trade and thrive.  
Where our relations are based on respect and partnership, and guided by the ASEAN 
Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.  
Where all states can contribute to a strategic equilibrium in a regional order in which 
countries are not required to choose sides, but can make their own sovereign choices.  
We recognise we must bring more to the table in Southeast Asia.  
This starts with an additional $470m in development assistance, and a forthcoming 
strategy on economic engagement.  
And we must contribute to the strategic balance of the region.  
We don’t want to see any one country dominating – or any country being dominated.  
We cannot accept a situation where large countries determine the fate of small er 
countries.  
That is why Russia’s illegal, immoral invasion of Ukraine cannot be normalised and it 
cannot be minimised.  
Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an attack on all smaller countries.It is an assertion that a larger country is entitled to subjugate a s maller neighbour – to 
decide whether another country can even exist.  
It was never intended that the Security Council veto power would be used to enable 
unchecked abuse of the UN charter - by the very countries that were given the veto.  
So it is especially important for countries that play leading roles in international fora, 
and countries with influence on Russia, to exert their influence to end this war.  
In this, the world looks to China, a great power, a Permanent Member of the Security 
Council, with a “no limits partnership” with Russia.  
Mr Putin’s weak and desperate nuclear threats underline the danger that nuclear 
weapons pose to us all, and the urgent need for progress on nuclear disarmament.  
Australia has always pursued a world without nuclear weapons , and we will redouble our 
efforts towards this goal - and to strengthening the non-proliferation regime.  
The death and destruction in Ukraine reminds us all how much we have to lose if we fail 
to protect the UN Charter.  
It reminds us that each nation must make its own choices, and exercise its own agency.  
We cannot leave it to the big powers.  
And we cannot be passive when big powers flout the rules.  
Aside from terrible damage and loss of life in Ukraine, Russia’s invasion is compounding 
human suffering; propelling the global crisis in food and energy security.  
In my own region, where geopolitical contest becomes ever sharper, we must ensure 
that competition does not escalate into conflict.  
Because if conflict were to break out in the Indo-Pacific, it would be catastrophic – for 
our people and our prosperity.  
And with the Indo-Pacific’s centrality to global prosperity and security, the cost would 
extend far beyond our region and reach into every life.  
So I say to small and medium sized nations like my own: we  are more than just 
supporting players in a grand drama of global geopolitics, on a stage dominated by 
great powers.It is up to all of us to create the kind of world to which we aspire – stable, peaceful, 
prosperous and respectful of sovereignty.  
That is the very rationale for the United Nations itself.  
It is up to all of us to ask ourselves how can we each use our state power, our influence, 
our networks, our capabilities, to avert catastrophic conflict?  
How do we acquit our responsibilities to constrain tensions - to apply the brakes before 
the momentum for conflict in our region or beyond becomes unstoppable?  
Australia is resolved to these tasks, in all our diplomacy, in the UN and beyond.  
It is why we seek a seat on the UN Security Council for 2029-2030.  
It is why we seek reform of the Security Council, with greater permanent representation 
for the Africa, Latin America, and Asia, including India and Japan.  
Being genuinely committed to the United Nations means being genuinely committed to 
reform ing the United Nations and keeping it vital.  
We know that we will always be better off in a world where rules and norms – whether 
on trade, the maritime domain or military engagement, on the environment or human 
rights – are clear, mutually negotiated and consistently followed.  
History teaches us that the alternative to what we have built here is conflict and chaos.  
A world where differences and disputes are settled by size and power alone, instead of 
by agreed rules and norms.  
Humanity has benefited from the multilateral system – from the rules that have 
underpinned an unequalled period of human development.  
Humanity will pay the price if we allow it to flounder.  
Every nation, and all our peoples.

NEW YORK, 23 SEPTEMBER 2022 
 
UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY , 77TH SESSION  
GENERAL DEBATE  
 
 
STATEMENT BY H.E.  MRS. DOMINIQUE HASLER  
MINISTER  OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY 
 Mr. President , 
Excellencies , 
Ladies and Gentlemen  
 
We gather this year at a time of enormous challenge s: Geopolitical conflicts , mass 
displacement, food insecurity and the effects of the pandemic continue to make people  suffer  
around the globe and pose massive threats to human security. And we need more ambition 
and effective action to fight climate change . In short: We are off track to meet the Sustainable 
Development Goals . The conclusion from all of this should be obvious to all: We urgently  need  
to recall our commitment to “leave no one behind”, and to come together, for the sake of our 
common interest, embrace multilateralism and redouble our political investment in the United 
Nations.  Instead, we are witnessing a frontal assault on the Charter of the United Nations itself. 
The aggression against Ukraine is nothing less than an attack on th e international  world  order  
established after the second world war .  Indeed , this  order, which we have all built up together , 
and which is best represented right in this General Assembly Hall  is being challenged in its very 
foundation . This act of aggression, carried out with  complete disregard for the most basic rules 
of international l aw, is an un precedented test to our resolve to stand up together  for our 
international order. We in Liechtenstein are committed to defending our freedom.  We have 
joined with our partners from our region, in particular with the European Union, but also from 
other parts of the world, to stand united with Ukraine and to stand against aggression, 
wherever it is committed.   
 
Mr. President  
We have witnessed dramatic events in the past few months, developments  of historic 
dimension s for the United Na tions: A military build -up on the borders of one of the founding 
members of this organization, meeting  the threshold of the threat of use of force foreseen in 
the UN Charter, accompan ied by denial and disinformation. After the military attack on Ukraine 
commenced, the Security Council was blocked, predictably, yet again through the veto. 
However, for the first time in decades, it then invoked th e Uniting for Peace formula and 
 handed its competence over to this As sembly. The resolution passed in this hall, with an 
overwhelming majority, on 2 March, will stand out as a landmark  in the history of th e United 
Nations. Condemning th e aggression against Ukraine in unequivocal terms  was of enormous 
importance. It back s the international response to this assault on our rules based order. Just as 
importantly, it lays the foundation  for what we should do going forward : Holding those political 
and military leaders criminally accountable who have initiated th e aggression committed 
against Ukraine. The source of all the crimes committed in Ukraine  is the crime of war itself. 
Therefore, as President Zelensky also made clear  in his speech to this Assembly this week : 
addressing the crime of aggression  is a powerful de terrent  to help  defend  the international 
order  reflected in th e UN Charter . The newly announced sham referend a for parts of occupied 
Ukraine  are a continuation of th e aggression, and make a mockery of the right to self -
determination – a cornerstone of th e UN Charter  and th e international order .  
 
Mr. President  
This is also a moment for us to not just reflect on the future role of this organization – but to 
decide together  which United Nation s the planet needs today. This organization is playing a 
crucial role in the current global challenge s – be it humanitarian assistance,  global public health, 
nuclear safety or food security. It enjoys strong support and high levels of trust  among the 
wider public. At the same time,  it continues to disappoint – especially in its core task, the 
maintenance of international peace and security. Its mission “to save succeeding generations 
from the scourge of war” is deeply ingrained  in the collective conscience  
of the peoples on whose  behalf it works. But more often than not, it does not meet these 
expectation s. For us in Liechtenstein, maintaining peace and security remains the core purpose 
of this organization. And we remain committed to being part of the change required to have 
the United Nations at the center of this effort – through prevention, mediation and collective 
action. In this spirit, Liechtenstein has put before this Assembly the “Veto Initiative” adopted 
earlier this year. I wish to thank all those partners who have supported this idea. And I am 
grateful for the way it continues to resonate, far outside this building. The Veto Initiative of 
course  introduce s a very important measure of accountability for the use of the veto. But more 
 importantly, it creates a policy space for this Assembly – to step in where the Security Council 
is paralyzed or deadlocked, as it may well be on frequent occasion s in the future. The veto, 
indeed, is no longer the l ast word.  
 
Mr. President  
In some of th e ongoing conflicts, we are witnessing the use of military force in its m ost crude 
and brutal  form. But in parallel , we are also dealing with cyberwarfare , which has added an 
insidious and often invisible layer of challenges to our collective security. Liechtenstein is a 
small country in the heart of Europe. We do not have armed forces. Therefore, we must  rely 
solel y on the respect for the rule of law and on strong par tnership s in the region and beyond. 
We are certainly shocked by the  frontal assault on  the European security architecture. And we 
are horrified that military force, in its crudest form is, against our hopes and beliefs, applied 
again in our part of the world. And yet, in thinking about our national security, our biggest 
concern are the insidious ways in which cyberspace is used  to undermine democratic 
institutions, the foundations of our societies, the very basis of our prosperity and of the peace 
we have enjoyed for long decades. Addressing these threats  and enforcing international law in 
cyberspace is therefore one of the key challenges we must face .  
 
Mr. President  
When addressing this Assembly in the past, Liechtenstein has  regularly talked about the nexus  
between peace and justice. About the need to ensure accountability for the most serious 
crimes under international law,  if we are  to be successful in our efforts to achieve lasting peace. 
Time and again – in Myanmar, in Syria, in other places – we have witnessed how impunity has 
led to more and often even more  serious atrocities, to crimes against humanity, to genocide, 
causing immense  human s uffering, destroying societies, and destabilizing whole regions. The 
aggression against Ukraine is but the most recent illustration of this sad pattern. This war is not 
only illegal in and of itself , it is also carried out with systematic disregard  for international 
humanitarian law, in particular the Geneva Conventions, mirroring the playbook of the conflicts 
in Syria and elsewhere. As a long -standing supporter of th e International Criminal Court, we 
 have supported the referral of the situation in Ukraine to the ICC. This referral is a decisive test 
in two ways  – of th e effectiveness of the Court. But also of our consistency in extending political 
and financial support to it. This is our chance to illustrate our resolve not just to prosecute 
crimes committed in Ukraine, but to give steady support to an ICC that does its work 
independently , across the globe,  and fully in line with its founding treaty, the Rome Statute.   
 
Mr. President  
Our w ork to address the UN’s role to safeguard peace and security must  embrace a 
comprehensive notion of security, with climate change one of the key threats . Every year  
natural disasters  and extreme weather events  increase  in se verity and frequency . Yet our 
collective understanding of the threat is not matched by the determination  to move forward  – 
together, with the required sense of urgency . Progress in the climate neg otiations has been 
insufficient  – and the pandemic, armed conflict s and challenges to energy supplies have done 
their part  to contribute  to a negative outlook . Our collective action in the framework of the 
COP process will remain instrumental . But it may well not be enough, in and of  itself, to achieve 
the goals  we hav e set ourselves  in the Paris Climate Accord. Many of our friends  are 
contemplating legal avenues  to fight climate change.  And in line with our commitment to the 
rule of law, we are open to work with them.  In conclusion : Protecting the planet and saving the 
livelihoods of future generation s are the biggest challenge s of our time.  And th e ultimate test 
of our ability to be truly united nations.  It is our duty  to take action  together,  to ensure that no 
person, no country and no region are left behind. Everyone committed to these goals  will find 
a reliable partner in us.

 BHS_77_2022,"NATIONAL STATEMENT  ON THE OCCASION OF  THE 77TH SESSION OF  THE GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY OF  THE UNITED NATIONS  
 
NEW YORK  
  
 
 
HON. PHILIP DAVIS, KC, MP  
PRIME MINISTER OF  
THE COMMONWEALTH OF THE BAHAMAS  
 
NEW YORK  
 
SATURDAY 24TH SEPTEMBER 2022 
 
A.        INTRODUCTION  
 
Your Excellencies;  
Distinguished Delegates;  
Secretary -General, Antonio Guterres;  
President of the General Assembly, His 
Excellency Mr.  Csaba Kőrösi  [CHA-BA KO -RO-
SHI]  of Hungary;  
  
 
B.        BAHAMAS PERSPECTIVE 
 
Next year will mark 50 years since The 
Bahamas became a full y independent, 
sovereign nation.  
Our accession to full membership of the United 
Nations in 1973 was inspired by a recognition of 
the inter -dependence of this Family of Nations, 
and by the hope that dialogue and partnership 
can be the path to shared solutio ns. 
 
We Bahamians  are – justifiably, I believe -- 
proud of what we have  accomplished  in our 
fifty years of independence. We are free, 
democratic , entrepreneurial, and resilient,  and 
our small size has not held us back from great 
achievement s at home and on the world stage.  
 
But we are ever more aware that many of our 
greatest challenges emanate from, or are made 
worse by, events and conflicts outside of our 
borders. 
Hurricane Dorian, in 2019, was a Category 5 
storm that nearly destroyed two of our main 
islands . 
It wiped out 30% of our national economic 
activity.  
The impact on our economy, on our 
infrastructure , and on our people  is still very 
much present.  
  
The scientific consensus is , that as ocean  
temperatures rise, we can expect hurricanes of 
greater intensity to arrive with increased 
frequency . Small island nations like mine did 
not create the emissions that are warming the 
earth, but nonetheless, we are on t he frontline 
of climate catastrophe . 
 
Dorian in 2019 was followed by COVID -19 in 
2020. 
 
What happens in industriali zed countries 
doesn’t stay in industriali zed countries. 
Every year, w e welcome millions of visitors to 
The Bahamas ; they are drawn by our country’s 
beauty, culture,  and people.  But for a long 
while, visitors could not come. This health crisis 
quickly became an economic crisis, and an 
education crisis, too.  
 
Now, as we  are working to recover, a global 
inflation crisis stubbornly endures . 
It is making the basics of life unaffordable for 
too many  and creating more hardship for our 
people. 
The same is true for other countries, in the 
CARICOM  region and around the world.  
 
And of course, day in, and day out , we must 
also defend our thousands of miles of ocean 
borders from trafficking in people, drugs, and  
guns.  
 
But w e’re not waiting for others to act; we’re 
doing what we can to be stronger,  and to be 
more prepared. 
But n o one country – large or small  – acting 
alone, can stop climate change . 
Nor can we  individually, reduce  the threat of 
future pandemics, or end the policies and 
conflicts driving global inflation , or tackle  global 
criminal networks . These problems require 
collective action.  
 
It was the second Secretary -General  of the UN , 
Dag Hammarskjöld  [DAG HAMMAR -SHOWLD] , 
who was candid about the purpose of this 
organization : 
“The United Nations was not created in 
order to bring us to heaven,"" he said, ""but 
in order to save us from hell.”  
 
The UN was born out of the ashes of two world 
wars.  
 
Today, we face different threats, ones that 
require us to mobilize , and innovate, and  – 
above all -- to collaborate . 
C.         CLIMATE CHANGE  and ENLIGHTENED 
SELF-INTEREST  
 
Of all the risks we face, none requires more 
urgent action  than the climate crisis. 
 
The first  UN climate conference took place in 
1992.  Yet, despite decades of conferences and 
meetings featuring warnings from scientists and 
experts, one-sixth of all the carbon emissions 
ever – some 407 billion tons -- occurred  
between 2010 and 2020.1 
 
I have frequently spoken, as have so many 
others, about th e need for action  in terms of 
climate justice, and fairness.  
 
Why should small island nations like mine – we 
who have contributed so little to the climate 
crisis – experience the biggest burdens and 
risks of a changing climate?   The argument 
 
1 David Fickling, “The 2010s Wrecked the Planet. Don’t Despair Yet ,” Bloomberg , 1 January 2020. 
might be straightforward – but it has not been  
effective . 
 
For a long time, decision -makers in both the 
public and private sector s believed that climate 
action must come at the expense of economic 
growth. But now, many are beginning to 
understand that climate inaction is the most 
expensive option of all.  
 
Taking action is not just in the interests of 
those of us who are particularly vulnerable. 
It is in the interest of every country.  
And it is this ‘enlightened self -interest’ that 
should motivate action.  
 
The good news is that there are also positive 
incentives  – transitioning to clean energy  is 
going to create jobs , increase efficiencies, and 
improve living standards.  
 
Again, don’t do it for us, do it for yourselves. 
I do not believe in despair; I believe in 
determination – and human ingenuity . 
 
We can do this . 
 
Countries that disagree on many other issues, 
including important ones, must co -operate on 
this issue , in their own self -interest.  
 
We have roughly 40 days until COP27, in Egypt. 
Let this be the year that we turn talk into 
action . 
Let’s roll up our sleeves and get to wo rk. 
Let those who pledge, write the cheque.  
 
Countries like mine, already trapped by billions 
in climate debt, need funding  to transition to 
renewable energy  infrastructure s. We have 
begun to install solar microgrids across our 
islands, but scaling -up will require a lot of 
additional funding. 
We in The Bahamas are playing our part.  
 
In February and July of this year, we hosted the 
‘One Young World Regional and Annual 
Conferences’ for young people to support the 
next generation in their efforts to engage with 
climate -related issues.  
This was the first climate conference for young 
people in the region.  
 
We recognize the importance and value of the 
participation of young people. 
The Bahamas supports the 2030 Agenda and 
our common agenda on youth engag ement.  
 
Then in August, The Bahamas took the lead in 
bringing together the member countries of the 
Caribbean, to agree a consensus position for 
negotiations at COP27.  
   
We are actively defining ways to protect and 
safeguard our shallow seas, mangroves and  
seagrasses, all of which act as a major carbon 
sink for the world. 
  
We urgently need to build capacity.  
 
Now, we are inviting those with potential 
technological solutions to bring their 
innovations to The Bahamas.   
 
 
D. MAJOR FINANCIAL REFORMS REQUIRED  
Mr. President:  
It’s time for new resolve and new cooperation. 
Last year, I brought to the attention of the 
General Assembly , the threat to the financial 
services industry in The Bahamas and our 
region.  
 
I said  then: “Financial Services is a crucial 
compon ent of the Bahamian economy. We see 
an indispensable role for the UN in leveraging 
its universal jurisdiction for greater oversight of 
global anti -money laundering, de -risking and 
tax co -operation matters.” 
Sadly, little to nothing has changed.  
 
We continue to struggle  to recover from the 
economic shocks of hurricanes and the Covid -
19 pandemic . We also have the additional  
battle  with inflationary pressures , created not 
by us, but by the war in Europe . 
And now, to top it off, we are yet again the 
victims of inequitable and unjust measures  on 
the part of major economic actors . 
All these factors place a stranglehold  on our 
national development , and that of other small 
island developing states.  
 
Just yesterday, the OECD issued a statement, 
placing The Bah amas on their blacklist.  
 
Mr. President:  
This action  is profoundly unfair. 
When we look at the countries that are flagged 
as high risk  and blacklisted, several startling 
commonalities emerge.  
Why is it that European states  that operate 
frameworks akin to that of high-risk or 
blacklisted countries , are not even eligible for 
inclusion on these lists?  
Why are all the countries targeted – all of them 
– small and vulnerable, and former colonies of 
European states ? 
We find it astound ing that the $2 -$3 trillion 
dollars which is estimated to be laundered each 
year through t he developed countries , are 
never flagged as causes for concern . 
 
And yet my country, which is widely recognized 
as one of the best -regulated countries in the 
world, and other countries like The Bahamas, 
are singled -out for such reputational attacks?  
The robust regulatory regimes of our Central 
Bank, Securities Commission , and Insurance 
Commission,  are chastised  on minor details of 
technical process, while much bigger 
transgressions in the developed world are 
ignored.  
 
The evidence is mounting, that the 
considerations behind these decisions have less 
to do with compliance, and more to do with 
darker issues of pre -judged , discriminatory  
perception s. 
Black-governed  countr ies also matter.  
 
Mr. President: 
We support the call for reforms in the global 
financial system to make it more relevant to the 
needs of today. But those reforms need 
ambition. They need to go beyond the 
incremental.  And they need to apply to all.  
 
For example, t he community of international 
financial institutions are in a position to forgive 
the debt incurred  by the economic shutdowns  
during  the COVID -19 pandemic. They should do 
so. 
Every year that we don’t do the r ight thing, the 
right thing to do becomes more expensive.   
 
  
 
D.        REGIONAL ISSUES: HAITI AND CUBA  
Mr. President:  
When my neighbours are in crisis , whether the 
cause is climate, or crime, or instability, The 
Bahamas is impacted by the humanitarian and 
security needs which arise. 
We repeat o nce again o ur opposition to the 
decades -long embargo and sanctions on Cuba.  
COVID  has exacerbated the situation for the 
people of Cuba, and made existing hardship 
and deprivation much worse.  
   
The people of Haiti continue to suffer.  The 
political vacuum left after the assassination of 
the President  just over a year ago, has led to 
more violence – with the instability fueling more 
tragedy and threatening the entire region. 
Migration is not the only regional issue which 
The Bahamas  is grappling with.  
 
We are also struggling from t he proliferation of 
guns. 
We do not manufacture  guns in our country , 
and yet they  illegally find their way to The 
Bahamas, and within days, can be connected to 
some criminal activity.  
  
In an archipelagic nation, made up of some 700 
islands and cays, and ranged across 100,000 
square miles of water, defending our borders  is 
an expensive challenge . 
  
We believe  more manageable and effective 
efforts can be made at the source, to ensure 
that a right to bear arms does not so quickly 
and easily translate into a right to traffic arms.  
  
  
E.         INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS  
Mr. President: 
We in The Bahamas believe there is still real 
purpose in the mission of this United Nations.  
We will continu e to support multilateral efforts 
to tackle the shared  challenges of our time . 
 
We congratulate Secretary -General Gutteres  for 
his leadership in achieving agreement with 
Ukraine, Russia and Turkey, to get the flow of 
trade in the Black Sea moving once again.  
The stabilization in world food markets has 
helped millions of people in the developing 
world. 
 
We see the involvement and participation of 
women and young people as inherent and 
central to our process.  
My government considers it vital that women 
play fully active roles in planning and decision -
making, both in national and multilateral affairs.  
 
We also support  the addition of a United 
Nations Youth Office. 
The needs and rights of Small Island 
Developing States cannot be sustained by 
making policy advance s only in times of global 
shock.  
We are grateful that the Alliance of Small Island 
States  seized the moment  in 2020, to secure 
the course of work on the Multi -Dimensional 
Vulnerability Index.  
We consider this a critical step forward in 
ensuring greater equity for countries such as 
The Bahamas. 
We are aware that the global community is 
grossly under -prepared i n securing protections 
of the global commons : that includes  water , 
biodiversity , and the digital landscape.  
  
In moving forward on this agenda, we also 
recognise that a more robust, and better 
change -making architecture , is needed across 
the United Nation s. 
  
In this respect, we hope that members will 
support the candidature of Stephen Bereaux for 
the seat of Director of the  Telecommunications 
Development Bureau of the I nternational 
Telecommunications Union, for the term 
running from 2023 – 2026.  
  
F.         CONCLUSION  
Mr. President:  
By each of us acting out of our own 
‘enlightened self -interest’, we acknowledge that 
we ourselves benefit from doing what is in the 
best interest of us all. 
In meeting the existential challenge posed by 
the climate crisis, it should be an increasingly 
self-evident truth, that none of us can be safe 
until we are all safe.  
  
Thank you.

H.E. Antonio Guterres, Secretary -General,  
Excellencies, Heads of State and of Government  
Heads of Delegation   
Ladies and gentlemen  
 
Mr. President,  
Please accept my warmest greetings and congratulations on your election to the 
presidency of this 77th Session of the United  Nations General Assembly  (UNGA) . I 
commit my delegation’s fullest support and cooperation in the fulfilment of your 
important duties.  
 
I also  commend your predecessor, His Excellency, Abdulla Shahid, of the Maldives, 
for his able guidance of the last Session of the General Assembly.  
 
Mr. President,  
I am extremely honoured to speak at this important global forum for the first time, 
on behalf of the Government and people of Grenada . 
 
Exactly three (3) months ago, today, the people of Grenada exercised  their 
democratic right and voted for transformation . In free and fair elections,  and 
through a solid mandate at the polls, the Grenadian people placed their confidence 
in me to lead our country over the next five years.  
 
Mr. President,Today, I bring my transformation al agenda to the UNGA,  because although we are 
an island state, our world do es not exist in isolation . Successful and sustainable 
transformation in Grenada is inevitably tethered  to the sustainable forward 
movemen t of the global community.  
 
Mr. President,  
This noble institution is nearing its eighty  (80) year anniversary, a significant 
milestone that is worthy of distinct recognition.  As my own country also draws near 
to a noteworthy  milestone, that of  fifty ( 50 years ) as an independent state , it is an 
appropriate time to renew our commitment to the principles of the United Nations 
Charter and to International Law. 
 
It is also a fitting time to review the achievements of past decades and proffer  
solutions to the challenges that have stymied progress.  
 
Mr. President,  
The COVID -19 pandemic brought our world to a standstill , without pre judice  for the 
size and economic might of nations . For a time, this disease was the great equalizer 
and forced us all to re -evaluate our priorities and our approach to working 
together.  
 
Grenada notes, with relief, news from the World Health Organization (WHO) that 
we might finally be entering the tail end phase of the pandemic. While we welcome 
the return to some semblance of “normal”, it is my sincere hope  that the lessons 
learnt from th e pandemic will remain and we  will not return  to business as usual.Mr. President,  
The monumental challenges posed by the pandemic were unprecedented  and 
seemingly insurmountable . Amid this worldwide  disaster,  however, our global 
community rallied and demonstrated what is possible  when we resolve to work 
together towards a common goal.   
 
The pandemic taught us all the value of international cooperation, the timely 
exchange of information and the sharing of resources critical to avoiding and 
mitigating similar global occurrences.  
 
Mr. President,  
It is imperative that t he matter of climate change be escalated to this level of 
urgency amongst our community  of nations . The d evastating effects of global 
warming can already be felt all over the world  with  higher temperatures  worsening 
many types of disasters, including storms, heat waves, floods, and droughts.  Our 
planet is undoubtedly in crisis , but as the ancient Chinese proverb reminds us: 
“crisis is opportunity riding a dangerous wind.”   
 
This window of opportunity is quickly closing, however, an d we no longer have the 
luxury to kick these issues down the road . We are now faced with the reality that 
tomorrow, is today.  
 
Mr. President,We have tinkered long en ough and must now accept that the solutions to the 
problems we face may not be found in this grand hall , or in the highest echelons of 
global climate discussions, but rather with the people  – especially our young 
people, who stand  to lose the most  from the inaction of our current leaders.  
 
Mr. President,  
Approximately sixty (60)  percent of the world’s population is under thirty -five years 
old. In my own country, f ifty (50) percent of the current population is between 
eighteen (18) and thirty -five (35) years  of age . Young people are therefore critical 
to the success of sustainable development policies and must  play a central role in 
the implementation of the targets set by the 2030 Agenda.  
 
Mr. President,  
I call on all young people to  take action.  It is not yet too late to do what is necessary 
to safeguard our planet for future generations, but the time for action is now.  The 
reality is, the leaders of today will not be around to feel the consequences of their 
decisions . It is t herefore up to  our youth , to lead the charge for the future they  
want to see.   
 
To all young people: I challenge you today, to choose to be agents of change over 
victims of climate change.  
 
It can start with small actions that cause ripple effects throughout  your famil ies and 
friend circles, your communities and eventually the wider world.Mr. President,  
It was not that long ago that I, too, was a young lawyer, seeking to evoke positive 
change in my community through small actions. I knew that I could no longer sit on 
the sidelines and wait for the leaders of the day to solve challenges that have 
plagued Grenadian society for well over a decade. I had to become the change.  
 
In October 2021, I made the decision to enter political life  and, shortly after,  was 
elected as the Political Leader of the National Democratic Congress . Only eight 
months later, Mr. President, I led the party  to victory winning nine  (9) of fifteen 
(15) seats.  
 
My presence here today is testament  that we can create the change that we would 
like to see , but it will only materialise if we step forward and accept the call to be 
the leaders of today.   
 
Mr. President,  
As leaders, the onus is also on us to create spaces where young people feel 
empowered to propose innovative solutions to the challenges we collectively face.  
This is a priority of my administration and has been backed by gender forward, pro-
youth policies and purposeful action . The appointment of the Honour able Kerryne  
James,  as Minister for Climate Resilience, the Environment and Renewable Energy 
at 23 years old , is a milestone for my country and the region, as Honourable James  
is the youngest Minister in the Caribbean.  
 
Mr. President,Confronting the climate crisis will require a complete transformation  of our  
mindset and behaviours but also, and importantly, the transformation  of our 
energy sources, economic models,  and land stewardship. This is a unique 
opportunity to come together , welcome innovative ideas , and tackle the problems 
we have struggled with for generations . Our goal, as responsible global citizens, 
should be to leave the planet as good as, or better, than we found it.  
 
This plea is not without urgency, Mr. President. As the leader of a Caribbean small 
island developing state (SIDS), I am all too familiar with the devastating  effects of 
climate change, and the stark reality that we may not have a country to pass on to 
future generations  – in the face of increasingly strengthened hurricanes and sea 
level rise.  
 
The small island states of the Caribbean are already experiencing si gnificant 
adverse effects due to climate change. With each hurricane season, that no w brings 
increased and more powerful storms, we watch and wait, with bated breath and a 
silent prayer, in the hope that this year it will not be “our turn .” 
 
In 2004, it wa s Grenada’s turn, with Hurricane Ivan . In the matter of eight (8) mere 
hours, we lost 34 souls and the category three (3) storm destroyed over 80 percent 
of our housing stock and decimated our economic and fiscal bases with damage  
surpassing 200 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. Ten (10) months later, in 
2005, it was Grenada’s turn, again , with Hurricane Emily.In recent years, we have watched  in horror as our brothers and sisters across the 
Caribbean experienced their “turn .” Most notably Hurricane Irma  in 2017 , which 
left the island of Barbuda  nearly uninhabitable  and wrought significant havoc on 
over ten other Caribbean island states, including  the British Virgin Islands, which 
lost approximately eighty -five (85) percent of its housing stock.  Only two weeks 
later, Hurricane Maria threatened , cruelly, to exacerbate the wounds freshly 
inflicted by Irma.   
 
Mr. President,  
The global community would remember the de struction  visited on Dominica by 
said Hurricane Maria , which  left 31 people dead, 37 missing, and an estimated USD 
930.9 million in damages.  
 
Mr. President , 
I can continue in this vein, highlighting the devastating consequences that  
Caribbean islands suffer  due to the warming climate , including the harmful effects 
on our rich biodiversity and underwater resources.  We are truly on the front lines, 
and we know, all too well, the ease with which one hurricane can wipe away 
decades of progress.  
 
As I stand here  today , several Caribbean islands are reeling fro m the wrath of 
Hurricane Fiona.  This is the reality we face, Mr. President, and why it is urgent that 
we act.  
 
Mr. President,Given the focus of my address here today, it is evident  that climate change and 
youth empowerment are inimical to Grenada’s transformational agenda . We 
continue to insist on a clear roadmap at the global level for ambitious climate 
action , to ensure  that global average temperatures remain  below the 1.5-degree  
Celsius  threshold.  
 
As we seek to b olster climate resilience  in our island home , I reiterate the call  for 
the urgent scaling -up of climate finance for adaptation  and the removal of the 
challenges that developing nations face to access climate financing . Additionally, 
my Government calls  for increased technology development  and capacity building , 
especially for young people.   
 
Mr. President,  
We are encouraged, and indeed proud , that a son of the soil has been given the 
responsibility to manage global climate action . The appointment of Simon Stiell as 
Executive Secretary of the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat s ends a clear 
message on the imp ortance of island voices in the fight against climate change . We 
are optimistic that we will achieve the mandates of the climate convention and its 
protocols, as well as the agenda for sustainable development.   
 
Mr. President,  
The Government of Grenada is steadfast in its commitment to creating paths 
towards sustainability and promoting diversity . Evidence of our resolve can be 
found in the first ever long -term National Sustainable Development Plan ( NSDP ) 
2020 -2035 , in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ), which isthe anchor for the country’s development agenda and priorities for the 15 -year 
period.  
 
In this regard, the Government of Grenada was pleased to be one of the 45 
countries that presented Voluntary National Reviews ( VNRs ) of the implementation 
of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, during the recently held  High-
Level Political Forum for sustainable development ( HLPF ).  
 
Mr. President,  
Our country -led review of progress towards the implementation of the 17 SDGs of 
the 2030 Agenda comes at a critical juncture in our collective efforts aimed at 
recovering from the extraordinary  socio -economic crisis created by the COVID -19 
pandemic.  
 
Mr. President,  
For Grenada, the pandemic exposed critical structural weaknesses and resource 
deficiencies in our health -care system. Managing the high incidence of non -
communicable diseases, theref ore, is an urgent priority and so too is addressing 
the mental health of our citizenry.  
 
In addition, Mr. President,  the economic fallout from the worldwide closure of 
borders  and stagnation of tourism – a key economic driver – exacerbated already 
elevated levels of unemployment and poverty.My Government intends to mitigate  such dire circumstances in the future by 
diversifying our economy  and developing  a robust ICT and Digi tal Economy . Trends 
such as converging technologies and the digitalisation of production are rapidly 
transforming work and life and they must be factored into training and 
development opportunities for our young people .  
 
Mr. President, we understand that t o adequately equip our young people for the 
future, inclusive and equitable quality education is fundamental. To this end, my 
Government has taken the necessary steps to ensure the framework for free 
universal education up to the community college level, and is committed to 
providing second chance opportunities to all youth who did not complete a 
primary, secondary, or tertiary education.  
 
Additionally, w e intend to  actively seek out opportunities for further studies in 
digital and  creative fields to support our emerging  creative and digital economies.  
 
Mr. President,  
The answers, once again, will lie with  our young people  and their invaluable 
contributions to the future of the labour force.   
 
My G overnment will  foster an environment where youth have access to the 
support and facilities needed to thrive. In particular, we intend to provide 
incentives to young entrepreneurs, upgrade our agriculture productions systems , 
and bolster our export capacity.Grenada will act deliberately to attract the attention and support of the 
international community and the favour of friendly nations as we seek to improve 
the standard of living of all citizens through the exploration of  new frontiers of 
economic and social development.  
 
Mr. President,  
As we emerge from the crisis of the COVID -19 pandemic , and optimistically prepare 
to transform our economy, we cannot ignore the  new crisis in the East due to 
current geopolitical tensions and conflicts , which has devastating and disruptive 
consequences for energy and food security.  
 
Mr. President,  
Russia’s war with Ukraine has already threatened international peace and stability 
and induced hardships upon nations uncon nected with the conflict. Grenada 
associates itself with the call of many nations for Russia to relent its war efforts in 
Ukraine and for the parties to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the conflict.  
 
Mr. President , 
Mindful that peace is a supreme asset and a legitimate aspiration of all peoples, 
Grenada renews its firm call for the Caribbean to remain a zone of peace.  
 
We also advocate for the economic, social and environmental development of all 
Caribbean states.In this regard, Grenada is satisfied that the removal of the US imposed economic, 
commercial,  and financial blockade  against Cuba  will facilitate  economic and social 
change there.  Additionally, we call for Cuba to be removed from the US State 
Department ’s list of countries that are co-sponsors of terrorism.  
 
Mr. President , 
In the same way, we lament  that more has not been done for our brother s and 
sisters in Haiti, a country classified as one of poorest among st us. The Caribbean  
Community (CARICOM) M ember States continues to pursue  various initiatives to 
assist;  however,  we believe  that more productive engagements must be 
undertaken , with all stakeholders , to help achieve political stability, peace,  and 
economic progress in Haiti . 
 
Mr. President , 
Grenada also reiterates its support for the ongoing judicial process at the 
International Court of Justice ( ICJ) aimed at bringing a definitive end to the long -
standing  Guyana/ Venezuela border dispute  and w e reaffirm our unwavering 
support for the territorial integrity of the Cooperative Republic  of Guyana .  
 
Mr. President,  
We further remain resolute in our call for an end to the imposition of unilateral 
coercive measures against the Republic of Venezuela , contrary to the rules and 
principles of Inter national Law and the Charter of the United Nations.Conclusion  
 
Mr. President  
The net effect of the recent and ongoing crises continues to seriously dislodge the 
world economy and, in turn, the ability of countries to achieve the Sustainable 
Development Goals. The adverse impacts on production, employment and poverty 
are growing, wh ile at the same time, jeopardising fiscal management in many 
countries.  
 
The Government of Grenada is firm in its determination to achieve the full 
implementation of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. We call, 
however, for the increased inclusion of youth voices as we seek to chart the future 
of our planet .  
 
We further note, that if small island states are to eliminate poverty and attain 
sustainable  levels of development, the vulnerability criteria, now applicable to our 
countries, must be comprehensively reviewed as a matter of urgency.  
 
The consequence of upper middle -income status afforded Grenada, and many 
other small states, without consideration of our specific vulnerabilities, continues 
to hinder our ability to access concessionary and grant financing.  
 
We continue to call for a new Multi Vulnerable Index (MVI), which would eliminate 
the threat to our economic development and security , and we encourage  thesubmission of additional  proposal s that seek to address similar  challenges that 
prevent our countries from moving forward on equal footing.  
 
Mr. President,  
The United Nations  system , over the last 77 years , has contributed immensely  to 
humanity . It is now time to consider  strategic transformation  if we are to achieve 
the goals set out in the 2030 Agenda and safeguard our plan et for future 
generations.   
 
Thank  you.", GRD,2022

Address by H.E. Dimitar Kovachevski,  
 Prime Minister of the Republic of North Macedonia  
 
General Debate - 77th UN GA Session:  
New York, 24 September 2022  
 
 
 
 
Dear President of the United Nations General Assembly,  
Dear Secretary General of the United Nat ions,  
Dear Heads of State and Colleagues - Heads of Government,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
The best and strongest tactic is unity. A lesson that sport players already 
know that a united team can achieve much more than a single player, is a 
lesson that the worl d of today is learning in unanticipated circumstances in 
the XXI century: first the pandemic, and now the cruel war in Ukraine. Now 
and in the future, the democratic world needs unity inovercom ing the 
globally spread consequences that countries in Europe a nd worldwide are 
facing.  
As of the start of making joint and united efforts in response to the start of 
the war, the Republic of North Macedonia immediately and decisively 
aligned itself with the European Union foreign policy and that of the 
democratic wor ld. We joined global efforts in response to the war as a 
country committed to peace and to finding dialogue -based solutions, as a 
country fully dedicated to European values. In doing so we relied on our 
own experiences and lessons learned according to whic h peace, strength 
and progress can be achieved only with unity. Welearned this lesson both 
 when we peacefully declared independence in 1991 and in 2001 when we 
rose above the internal inter -ethnic conflict, while today we rely on our 
experiences in pursuin g our established concept of “One society for all”, 
setting thus an example of a functional multi -ethnic democracy, while  being 
a significant factor of stability in the Western Balkans and consequently in 
Europe, as well, which on its part makes us a relia ble partner of the 
international democratic community.  
Functional solutions, solutions that work in a small area always serve as a 
roadmap to finding solutions in the global setting. No matter how many 
challenges arise in a given wide geographic area, the y do erupt in a certain 
smaller area, becoming th en a potential global threat. That point of eruption 
today is an independent and sovereign state – Ukraine, whose citizens are 
faced with na unacceptable and unjustifiable  aggression by the Russian 
Federatio n. 
There are two especially concerning aspects , which demand our full 
attention. One of them is related  to the fact that a permanent member of 
the United Nations Security Council commit ted the aggression  – the 
Russian Federation. The fact that a country  has decided to resolve a 
challenge using force despite being a member of an organization , which is 
founded on the commitment to preserving world peace runs contrary to all 
endeavours  and commitments of the civilized world to putting an end to all 
forms of ac tions which ca use loss of human life and jeopardize the global 
peace. Furthermore, the demonstration of force by a geographically larger 
country  against a geographically smaller country, which is committed to 
fostering and sharing democratic values , is a d angerous and impermissible 
precedent. In simple terms, everything must be done in order to prevent 
that this become a practice in this world we share , where there are 
geographically smaller and bigger countries .  
As we can see problems are multidimensional  and affect us all. These are 
challenges we all face, in the most severe winter we have ahead of us 
since World War  II: to ensure availability of food and energy for our 
citizens.  
Therefore, we must search for solutions acting in unison.  
Response or solut ions to interlocking challenges is the essential topic of 
this debate, i.e. , that solutions are to be found in solidarity; solutions must 
be sustainable , and science based . 
 Speaking about sustainability, I believe we should take into consideration 
another bitter experience from the war in Ukraine. The struggle for peace is 
on-going and peace necessitates continual dedication to mutual 
understanding, vigilance , and prompt reactions.  
Dear Colleagues,  
Delegates,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,   
I should like to c onvey a clear message from my country: the unprovoked 
aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine is a gross violation 
of the United Nations Charter and of international law norms and principles. 
The aggression cannot be justified or be relativize d. The Russian 
Federation must put an immediate end to the aggression and withdraw its 
troops from Ukraine. History teaches us that no problem can be resolved 
by using force. Putting an end to the aggression is the necessary 
precondition in order to open t he only feasible way  of finding a solution and 
that is diplomacy and dialogue. The latter can and must be the sole 
mechanism for settling disputes and resolving differences  between 
countries.  
The uncertainty of food and energy supply will deepen differenc es at the 
global level between the rich North and the poor South and will bring 
millions of people at the brink of their existence, even being threatened with 
hunger. We will all feel the impact, both economically more developed and 
economically less devel oped countries. We must  rely on lesson s learned 
from the pandemic, i.e. , international solidarity is not to be guided by the 
fact whether solidary is needed among better developed countries or is 
required among less developed countries. This especially if we want to 
prevent the rise of new challenge s ensuing from the growing dissatisfaction 
of citizens in global terms.  
The pandemic reminded us all that we are all equal when faced with a 
common, in this case invisible enemy that took millions of human lives  
worldwide. The pandemic also b rought to light the importance of solidarity 
and unity, transposed into concrete intentional cooperation. These are the 
principles that should guide our future actions when facing present and 
future challenges.  
In the specif ic context of overcoming the consequences of the war in 
Ukraine, it is necessary to double the efforts in enhancing international 
 solidarity and mutual assistance on equal footing, both in the European 
Union, where the Ukraine  war impact is of the largest scope, by also 
worldwide. This particularly applies to finding viable solutions  to overcome 
challenges relating to energy supply, but food, as well. In this context, I 
would like to underscore the important active role of Secretary General 
Guterres, as wel l as of Turkiye mediating in the exports of wheat from 
Ukraine .  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Developments in and surrounding Ukrainehave pushed numerous other 
conflicts worldwide in the background. However, the focus on such conflicts 
must remain sharp. Terrori sm in all its forms is still a global threat 
jeopardizing the entire humanity. Numerous hybrid threats ca use great 
concern and distress. Fake news and the possibility provided by social 
networks, i.e., by internet communication that such news is spread on a 
mass scale is a challenge facing the entire democratic world. Authoritarian 
tendencies, disguised under the veil of disingenuous patriotism pose a 
serios threat to human rights and freedoms and prompt potential 
instabilities. We also face the burning cli mate change issue, despite all 
endeavours  for putting up a joint and united front in saving our Planet 
Earth. The r ecent catastrophic floods in Pakistan are but one of the last 
visible consequence s in the series of extreme natural disasters worldwide, 
occu rring due to climate change . Losing biodiversity, air pollution and the 
lack of water impose themselves as priority threats, not only against the 
environment and ecosystems, but also against people’s lives. And such a 
situation will persist until every ind ividual becomes fully aware that nature is 
not ours, but is part of us, and we should treat it as such. All these 
problems demand concerted  actions, founded on intensified and 
consolidated efforts that would be focused both on prevention and on 
finding sol utions.  
Conflicts, instability, violence, climate change cause the spread of grave 
poverty for millions of people, as well as displacement of population , which 
is growing into an exodus. Emigration waves we faced in past years 
coming from Syria and Afghan istan are not winding down. Now we also 
have millions of refugees from Ukraine.  
The Republic of North Macedonia opened its doors to citizens of Ukraine, 
who forced to flee their homeland sought refuge in our country. This is a 
good opportunity that we dul ly commend countries worldwide that received 
the largest number of refugees, as well as substantial number  of citizens 
 throughout the world who work every day  to provid e care for refugees and 
help those in need. My country, the Republic of North Macedonia,  using its 
available capacities, remains committed to honouring  international 
commitments in the humanitarian area. In order that we successfully deal 
with and manage immigration of diverse types , it is necessary t o strengthen 
the awareness that it is a ma tter of a global challenge , which necessitates 
coordinated activities in pursuance with the shared responsibility principle.  
Dear Colleagues,  
We learn from experience  that no problem is a minor problem . Every minor 
problem  has the potential  of growing  into a more difficult and larger scale 
problem. However, our coming  together thesed ays a t the seat of the United  
Nations serves as a  good reminder  that strength  and solution scan be 
achieved  by uniting ourselves  in support  of genuine values. Multilateralism  
and respect  for established rules and obligations , starting  with the United 
Nations Chatter are the only way of providing  the much -
needed predictability  in international  relations.  
We are building our future now, today, and together. Despite all 
deficiencies of  international mechanisms, multilateralism,  and the United 
Nations , as its most visible and recognized form , having the universal 
mission of preserving the peace, are still the key importance catalysts 
encouraging joint efforts towards better, safer,  and m ore just world.  
Global challenges require global response. No country could deal with XXI 
century problems acting on its own. Now, more than ever, we need to 
demonstrate that multilateralism works and gives results in times of cris es. 
In this context, the Report “Our common agenda” by Secretary General 
Guterres is to be our roadmap in pursuing global governance reforms, 
which would open the way for the UN multilateral central system to adapt to 
the future and be able to contribute to joint endeavours . 
The 2 030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of course remains the 
starting point in pursuing global actions. This Agenda not only addresses 
chronic and persistent problems of poverty and inequitable development, 
but it can also serve as a platform for finding s olutions to all other 
problems, starting with the necessity that we unite standing behind a new 
agenda for peace, while placing the human dimension in the focus of 
technological development in the digital era. 
 The Republic of North Macedonia works intensiv ely to accomplish the 
Millennium Development Goals and supports all efforts aimed at making 
the United Nations stronger and more efficient.  
In pursuing the Millennium Development Goals, as well as other 
development activities in the national, regional,  and global settings, we 
need to ground ourselves on the supposition that we owe it to young 
generation s to provide them with conditions for progress .  
Young people, their access to modern forward -looking  education and 
resolution of problems they face must be the centre  of our attention and of 
our political engagement in the coming years. In this respect, I should like 
to emphasize that for the second consecutive year a youth delegate from 
the Republic of North Macedonia participates in the work of the General 
Assembly.  
Dear Friends,  
On 1 January 2023, the Republic of North Macedonia will have the honour  
of taking over the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Co -
operation in Europe,the largest regional security organization. This brings 
great resp onsibility, especially taking into consideration that my country is 
taking over the OSCE chairmanship  at times when there is a military 
aggression  in Europe , along with all ensuing consequences for the peace 
and security  in the OSCE area and wider. Yet, I am confident that we will 
successfully  justify the trust bestowed upo nus. North Macedonia, has 
sometimes been the beneficiar y of mediation -security  mechanisms, 
including the UnitedN ations peace  mission and has had first -hand 
experience with the benefits of  peace building efforts of the international 
community. Relying on such experience we stand ready to contribute to 
strengthening and developing the security in the wider context . As the 2023 
OSCE Chair, we will be fully committed to the noble mission of se rving 
peace and security, as a precondition for economic and social development 
and I am confident  that we will contribute to advancing multilateral security 
mechanisms.  
 Our confidence is based on our practices of living together  in unity and the 
related benefits in the national, regional,  and international setting. Today I 
am representing before all of you a country in which all ethnic communities 
have equal constitutionally guaranteed rights and obligations. We are 
working to make the Republic of North M acedonia a civic, democratic 
society in which differences are regarded as an enriching advantage, and 
 not as an obstacle. Standing united, as a multi -ethnic functional democracy 
today we are a successful example of a mini -Europe on the Balkans. 
However, ha ving in mi nd the significance of mutual understanding, respect,  
and support, which prompt and motivate unity , working together with our 
two neighbours , Albania,  and Serbia, we have established the Open Balkan 
Initiative. Today, this Initiative has grown in to a successful example of 
regional inter -connectivity. It has also contributed to our shared 
commitment to remov ing unnecessary barriers for movement of people, 
trade, transport of goods and provision of services . In the present 
circumstances the Initiati ve has enabled us to ensure availability of food for 
our citizens, based on our agreement to help each other if faced with lack 
of food on our respective domestic markets, as a consequence  of the 
global crisis; we have furthermore agreed that there will be  no bans on 
trade in basic agricultural and food products. We are also intensively 
considering options for cross -border trade in electricity and providing 
assistance with various energy sources, as part of our effort to overcome 
the serious energy situatio n the entire world is facing. We are also 
developing good -neighbourly  relations with a keen sense  of responsibility 
and by way of dialogue, convinced that safeguarding national and state 
interest does not run contrary to wider -scope integration processes a nd 
advanced cooperation with countries in our neighbourhood . Quite the 
contrary, self -affirmation finds its most relevant and appropriate reflection in 
a wider community of shared values . Guided by these policies of building 
bridges, whileemployingfunction al diplomacy, dialogue  and understanding  
we have succeeded in accomplishing  the strategic goal of becoming part of  
NATO  and today we are a proud fully-fledged member  of the Alliance . After 
long 17 years since we were granted  EUmembershipcandidate status , we 
have started accession negotiations  with the European  Union. My country 
attache sparticularimportance  to our speedy EU integration. We work with 
dedication and persistence to undertake  all steps required for the 
accomplishment  of my country’s second strate gic goal. I would  like to 
underscore that the EU membership  of the Republic  of North Macedonia is 
of essential importance also for the European  Union itself, especially in the 
new circumstances in the global context, in which such a message of 
encouragemen t, i.e. , that the enlargement  process continues and awaits  
the entire Region, which no matter  the progressive leadership, is not 
immune to globalchallenges . This especially in conditions  in which the 
Europeanintegration  and democratic  path of Western Balka n countries 
should and must be ensured , as a contribution to European  peace . 
 The story of my homeland, the Republic of North Macedonia, which two 
weeks ago celebrated 31 years of independence is a story of peace, 
cooperation  and understanding, employing w hich it was established, while 
dealing with challenges and overcoming threats both for our internal 
stability a nd on our way to international integration. Thus, I should like to 
underline that we are solution oriented, working together in facing 
challenges  that do not recognize state borders, ethnic, linguistic, religious 
or any other differences.  
Dear Friends,  
Colleagues,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
I am especially honoured  and pleased that as the Prime Minister of the 
Republic of North Macedonia, I have had the opportunity of address ing you 
for the first time here at the United Nations, the Organization that is the 
guardian of peace, solidarity,  and prosperity .  
I would like to offer my appreciation to Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the 
76th General Assembl y for his successful work. I am confident that Mr. 
Csaba Kőrösi, who took over the Presidency of the 77th General Assembly 
will be equally successful.  
The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have brought to light human 
weaknesses or fragility even in this modern XXI century. Yet, as the 
pandemic has also demon strated the power of human endurance and 
resilience, i.e. , the power of innovation and the capability of science to 
quickly produce the necessary vaccines, humanity must also continue 
relying on science and keep believing in its humanistic foundations and 
capabilities and peace.  
We are all in the same boat and we have no other choice except  to treat 
each other with soli darity and work in unity defending and advancing 
fundamental values of freedom and peace throughout the world. Peace is 
reached by making compromises, but peace is preserved with mutual 
understanding.  
Thank you for your attention.",MKD,2022

 Your Excellency  Mr. Csaba  Kőrösi , President of the 7 7th Session of the General 
Assembly,  
Your Excellencies Heads of State and of Government,  
Your Excellency Mr. António Guterres , Secretary General of the United 
Nations,  
Distinguished Delegates,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Mr. President,  
At the very outset, allow  me to congratulate  you on your well-deserved  election to 
the office of the President of the General  Assembly  for the 77th Session . Your 
illustrious career as a diplomat  assure s us of a successful session.  I assure you of 
my delegation’s full support  and cooperation during your tenure of office. I also  wish 
to commend your predecessor, H.E. Mr. Abdulla Shahid,  for his skilled stewardship 
in discharging his duties during the previous session.  
 
To Secretary General  Guterres, I extend my country’s gratitude and support for the 
tireless efforts in the daunting task of finding lasting solutions to the persistent 
problems  that face our organisation . 
  
We particularly commend you for your wide -ranging reform efforts to  equip the 
Organisation  to provide more effective support to Member States across the 
spectrum of challenges they face , including stronger partnerships for the 2030 
Agenda . We also welcome “Our Common Agenda ” Report  which focuses on the next 
25 years and represents your vision on the future of global cooperation through 
reinvigorated multilateralism with the United Nations at the centre of our efforts.  
Mr. President,  Excellencies,  
From the humble beginnings of a fledg ling organisation  more than seven decades 
ago, to a massive expansion in membership today, the United Nations has 
undoubtedly stood the test of time. Our organisation  has witnessed several changes 
in the configuration of international relations. Some were traumatic, while others 
were benign. The survival of the U.N. through all those tribulations testifies to its 
resilience and the enduring validity of its mission.  
 
Some of the great strides that the United Nations has made span peaceful settlement 
of disputes, restoring ca lm in many countries through peacekeeping, decolonisation , 
raising awareness of human rights and eradicating diseases. 
 Despite these laudable achievements, numerous challenges still remain in the path 
towards assuring humanity of a bright, prosperous, dig nified and secure future.  The 
continuous eruption of armed conflicts throughout the world, terrorism, climate 
change, diseases  and the lingering effects of the economic and financial crises and 
many others continue to transcend our borders and have remain ed in the foreground 
of international relations and pre -occupied the international community. It is in this 
context that we welcome the theme for our general debate, namely; “A watershed 
moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges.”  
Mr. President,  
We are living in uncertain times. The COVID 19 pandemic has changed the nature 
of multilateral engagement, diplomacy, business, and of basic human interaction. 
The pandemic has not only hastened the pace and scale of the digital revolution , but 
has also increased the gap between the “haves” and the “have -nots”, and furthermore 
exposed our vulnerability as Africa’s land locked least developed countr y. We, 
therefore, need to make concerted efforts to protect lives and empower the citizenry 
across t he globe through innovation and digital technologies to achieve sustainable 
recovery. It is of paramount importance for us as African leaders to be proactive in 
investing in research and development in readiness for certain future pandemic s. 
 At the same time, the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s), 
which was already anaemic prior to 2020, has been aggravated by the pandemic. The 
expectation of the international community was to intensify the Decade of Action to 
achieve SDGs, but sadly, we find ourselves in a pro -longed period of recovery.  
 
As we ushered in the new 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on 1 January 
2016, Member States , were optimistic that the better life for all is in sight. However, 
the 2030 deadline for the ac hievement of the SDGs is gradually approaching, yet 
there is still no significant progress in their attainment due to several factors that 
have adversely affected implementation. In addition to the pandemic , these include 
unpredictable global shocks including wars, climate -related events and lack of 
predictable f inancing .    
 
The environment in which we operate  is significantly less favourable than it was 
when we began six years ago. Our room to manoeuvre is much more const rained. 
Nevertheless, our quest to pursue a sustainable future must never wane. Unless we 
can work towards the SDGs in a true spirit of partnership, where each partner lives 
up to expectations, the Decade of Action will end as a Decade of Disappointment. 
 As Secretary General stated during the election of the P resident of the General 
Assembly in June  this year , “The 77th Session can be a moment of transformation ; a 
time to recalibrate multilateralism and strengthen the foundations of global 
cooperation”. In this regard, I appeal to all Member States to use the 77th Session to 
renew their determination to work together for the benefit of mankind  and to re -
commit th emselves to the cardinal principle of multilateralism. The role of 
multilateralism and the United Nations, has, therefore,  become ever more important. 
It is morally imperative that we unite our wills and pool our efforts for the well -
being of humanity.  
 
Mr. President, just recently, Lesotho was amongst the 45 countries that presented 
their Voluntary National Reviews during the High -Level Political Forum on 
sustainable development. Among other things, our review highlighted the pressing 
challenge of climat e change which has a direct bearing on food insecurity and 
poverty, not only in my country but in Africa as a whole. Climate change destroys 
our ecosystems and results in land degradation as well as contribute to the decline 
of agricultural productivity, w hich is the mainstay of small economies. 
 In this connection, my delegation calls upon all Member States to use the COP -27 
meeting  to be held on African soil, as an opportune time to address Africa’s 
challenges on climate change as well as support our nee ds and priorities  in the form  
of affordable and sustainable energy, capacity adaption and mitigation.  
 
We disagreed for far too long  on the subject of climate  change, until we were 
confronted by the glaring and compelling scientific evidence that the link between 
global warming and human activity is indisputable. Sadly, catastrophes have begun 
to hit, mostly affecting the poorest and most vulnerable countries.  
 
While we appreciate that there are resources aimed at helping developing countries 
to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, we are concerned that such 
funds are difficult to access. The global climate -finance architecture is complex, 
with variable structures of governance and modalities. Some finance is channelled 
through multilateral agencies, sometimes even outside the funding mechanisms of 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and some flows 
through bilateral developm ent assistance institutions, thereby making coordination  
difficult. Lesotho calls on the international community and our development partners 
to simplify the accessibility of funds earmarked for climate change . 
 Mr. President,  
The state of peace and security in the world is gradually getting worse with recurring 
conflicts and eruption of new ones in many parts of the world. The emergence of 
new extremist groups and terrorist entities has not only compounded the problem 
but, is a  stark reminder, that we must act collectively to discharge the moral 
responsibility resting on us to ensure that people everywhere enjoy the right to peace, 
development, and the sanctity of life. The use of military force alone as a strategy 
for combating  terrorism has never been a panacea for eradicating that menace. 
Terrorism requires a holistic approach that addresses its root causes. Similarly, we 
as leaders, should not turn a blind eye on the plight of civilians in all conflict areas. 
The internationa l community should be consistent in dealing with humanitarian 
crises in different parts of the world.  
 
We do not derive any comfort, Mr. President,  from the simmering trade and 
political tensions between two of the Founding Members of the United Nations, 
namely the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China.  We must 
remember that we came together as Members of the United Nations und er the 
premise that we are all peace -loving nations. The United Nations Charter enjoins us 
“to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good 
 neighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, 
and to  employ international machinery for the promotion of economic and social 
advancement of all peoples”. In this regard we call upon these two great nations  to 
show their fidelity to the principles underpinning our Organisation and resolve their 
differences a micably. Military power and aggression can never beget peace.  
 
In the same vein, the ongoing war in Ukraine and other parts of the world inflicts a 
reputational carnage on our beloved Organisation. Whereas p eaceful settlement of 
disputes lies at the heart of the work of the UN, we have, however, not sufficiently 
utilised  tools at our disposal, such as mediation  for solving conflicts between and 
among our Member States. Some take sides and support conflicts in one form or 
another, while others remain in hibe rnation. Lesotho, therefore, wishes to implore 
the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, to live up to its Charter  and be 
an honest and impartial mediator in conflicts. The resolution of international disputes 
based on dialogue, justice and the equality of all States must be at the heart of that 
strategy if it is to succeed. We must shun those who fan the flames of discord among 
us and indeed we must not allow ourselves to entertain any thoughts that through 
divisions there will be one side t hat will win. We will all perish and be on the 
precipice. 
  
We are mindful, however, that it will be difficult for the Security Council to 
effectively discharge its mandate while it remains an epitome of the 1945 
architecture of the world as seen by the vic tors of the Second World War. The reform 
of the United Nations, including the Security Council, can no longer be delayed. A 
reformed, transparent and more democratic United Nations, in which Africa is 
represented along the lines of Ezulwini Consensus, is n ecessary for preserving 
international peace and security and for confronting the challenges of development.  
All Member States need to garner the necessary political will to advance the 
intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform.  
 
We note w ith satisfaction  the statement by President Biden, delivered before this 
august House on the 21st of September 2022, in which he clearly articulated 
America’s support for representation of Africa and other unrepresented regions, in 
the UN Security Council,  particularly in the permanent category. Let us make the 
seventy -seventh session one for decisive action  on this matter.  
Mr. President,  
Today, we see heightened geopolitical tensions that have led to the re -emergence of 
protectionist trade policies. The economic war in terms of sanctions has the potential 
 to make global supply chains less efficient, subtracting from long term growth and 
adding pressure on prices. This state of affairs flies in the face of the resolve of the 
representatives who gathered in San Francisco to finalise  the Charter of the United 
Nations more than seven decades ago, who dreamed of a world of equality and 
shared pr osperity. They renounced a vision of a world in  of unilaterally imposed 
economic sanctions and financial blockades against others, or one in which peoples 
were denied their right to self -determination or were subjected to occupation.  
 
It would, therefore, be remiss of me not to unequivocally call for the lifting of all 
economic and political sanctions against Zimbabwe. In the like manner, we express 
solidarity with the tenacious people of Cuba for having endured economic sanctions 
for so many yea rs. We are confident that the United States of America, under the 
leadership of President Biden, will re -visit its position on the embargo against the 
Republic of Cuba and expand cooperation with Cuba on areas of mutual interest, 
including on trade and com merce, for the benefit of the Peoples of both countries. 
This, the United States did in 2016, through the Presidential Policy Directive, and it 
can surely do it again. We also want to express our unwavering solidarity with the 
People of Western Sahara, who  have languished under the hegemony of colonialism 
for far too long. I wish to underline, in particular, the General Assembly Resolution 
40/50 of 02nd December 1985, in terms of which the Assembly reaffirmed the fact 
 that the question of Western Sahara was  a question of decolonisation which 
remained to be completed on the basis of the exercise by the People of western 
Sahara, of their inalienable right to self -determination and independence. Equally, 
the UN Security Council in its Resolutions 1920 (2010), 1 979 (2011) and 2044 
(2012), recognised that the consolidation of the status quo in Western Sahara was 
unacceptable and called for an intensified pace of meetings and strengthening of 
contacts between the Parties in order to advance the organisation of the referendum. 
We call upon the international community to intensify efforts to bring to an end the 
question of Western Sahara.  
 
In the same vein, we express our unwavering support to the People of Palestine. 
Since the founding of the UN, the Question of Pale stine has been at the centre of the 
agenda of our Organisation. Yet, today, the Palestinian territory still remains under 
foreign occupation and its People endure untold pain and suffering. We call on the 
United Nations to intensify its efforts to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting 
settlement of the Question of Palestine.  
Mr. President,   
Allow me to conclude my remarks by pointing out that the regime of the Charter of 
the United Nations has so far done its part in preventing a third world war, there by 
 fulfilling one of the dreams of the architects of our beloved Organisation . The 
continued success and the relevance of the United Nations will depend, in large 
measure, on its capacity for self -renewal in readiness to meet modern -day 
challenges.  
 
We, th e United Nations, should continue to be the voice of the voiceless and the best 
hope for all humankind. Now is the time for leaders everywhere to join the race for 
transformative action that can drive peace, democracy, respect for human rights and 
the rule  of law, human dignity, economic competitiveness and sustainable prosperity 
for all. Lesotho will continue to be a persistent and resilient part of that initiative.  
I thank  you for your  attention.", LSO,2022

New York , 24th September 2022Mr President , 
Mr Secretary -General of the United Nations , 
His Excellencies Heads of State and Government , 
Distinguished Heads of Delegations , 
Excellencies , 
Ladies and  Gentlemen , 
 
1. I am highly honoured to participate in this 77th Session of the General Assembly, 
on behalf of His Excellency Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of the Republic 
of Mozambique  who, for agenda  reasons , cannot be present .   
 
2. I would like to congratulate His Excellency Ambassador Csaba Kőrösi  upon his 
election as President of th e current  Session of the United Nations General 
Assembly . I wish him success .  
 
3. Let me also commend the work done by your predecessor, His Excellency  Mr. 
Abdulla Shaid . Under his presidency , we have strengthen ed multilateral 
mechanisms in support of member states , to address global challenges such as 
COVID -19. 
 
4. To His Excellency Mr. António Guterres , United Nations Secretary -General, go 
our words of appreciation , for the wise manner in wchich he  led the work of Our 
Organisation.    
 
5. Allow me also,  o n behalf of the Mozambican People, to thank you all, United 
Nations Member States, for the support which contributed for the election of 
Mozambique as Non -Permanent Member of the Security Council for the term 2023-
2024.  
 
6. This election, w e take it with great responsibility . Basing on the motto of our 
candidacy , ""International Peace and Security and Sustainable 
Development"" , we will advocate  for the dialogue and for the peaceful resolution 
of  conflicts, for the promotion of peace, for the fight against terrorism, as well as , 
for the  role of multilateralism  as an important tool  to address the current 
challenges of the world.Mr President , 
Excellencies , 
 
7. The theme of  current Session of the General Assembly reveals  that, the world is 
going through adverse and challenging situations .  
 
8. And among them , we can highlight COVID -19, climate change and humanitarian 
crises, with their negative effets  on the global economy.  
 
9. The emergence of new outbreaks of internal tensions  and inter-state conflicts, 
terrorism , the international organised crime , are affect ing negatively  the economic 
and social development  of our countries . They are aggravating the food, energy  
and the humanitarian crisis . They are affecting negatively the functioning of the 
supply chain in international markets.  
 
10. That is why , Mozambique advocates for the need of a constructive dialogue and 
concerted multilateral actions, as these are the only avenues for the preservation 
of peace and the continued promotion of the sustainable development of our 
countries . 
  
Ladies and  Gentlemen ,  
 
 
11. For Mozambique , the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 will guide us in the  
search of collective solutions to problems of this time of change .  
 
12. As per our own experience ,  the incorporation of SDGs into the priorities and pillars 
of our governance program , has brought significant positive results in the 
household incomes  and the fight against poverty. As a result, we have seen 
encrease in:   
 
(i) Production and productivity in the agrarian sector, combined with the 
commitment to  the development of its entire value chain;  
(ii) Coverage of the supply of drinking water for the population, in particular in 
rural areas;  
(iii) Population with access to electricity;  
(iv) Coverage of the primary, secondary, technical -professional and higher 
education schools;  
(v) Rates of a ccess and retention of girls in school, particularly in rural areas; 
and(vi) Primary health care and vaccination programmes for children, as well as 
maternal and child health care.  
 
 
 
13. It is also remarkable the expansion of services  in the administration of justice, 
ensuring improved access to justice for citizens.  
 
14. We have also been promoting actions in the area of blue economy, as well as in 
the protection and conservation of the environment and ecosystems .  
 
15. However, our experience also shows that we need to rethink the multilateral 
institutional financing model that will allow more resources to be mobilised to 
complement internal efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. 
 
Ladies and  Gentlemen ,  
 
16. In the context of the prevention and combat  of COVID -19, the Government of 
Mozambique has adopted a set of measures to contain the spread of the pandemic , 
in order  to ensure the balance between saving human lives and keeping the 
economy running.  
 
17. Among these measures, we undertook massive vaccination  campains against the 
disease and, so far, 96.6% of Mozambican citizens over 18 years of age  are 
vaccinated . 
 
18. Excellencies, the re are lessons we draw from  the fight and preventi on of COVID -
19.  W e need: -   
(i) To have national health systems prepared to respond to health crises, which 
involves the provision and universal access to medical equipment and 
means necessary for prevention and treatment;  
(ii) funding to effectively respond to public health emergencies;  
(iii)  strengthening education and training of health professionals; and  
(iv) strengthening bilateral and multilateral cooperation, as well as greater 
interaction and dialogue be tween public and private actors, to respond 
more effectively to crises with global impact.  
 
 
Mr President , 
Excellencies ,19. Climate change places  Mozambique under permanent surveillance. In recent 
times, our country has been cyclically and intens ively affected by depressions, 
tropical cyclones, rains and strong winds, floods and droughts that have caused 
loss of human lives, displace ment of persons , extensive damage to infrastructure 
and socio -economic activities .  Just, b etween 2019 and 2022, Mozambique was hit 
by cyclones Idai, Kenneth, Guambe, Chalane,  Ana and Gombe.  
 
20. In order to respond to the challenges related to the reduction and risk 
manage ment of natural disasters, Mozambique, in coordination with the countries 
of the southern region of Africa and  cooperation partners, established in 2021, in 
the Nacala -Porto (north of the country ) the Center for Humanitarian and 
Emergency Operations of the  Southern African Development Community (SADC).   
 
21. This Centre is aimed to provide SADC countries with tools and institutions capable 
of responding to and mitigating the impacts of climate change and other 
emergencies requiring rapid, coordinated and timel y intervention in any Member 
State.  
 
22. Mozambique  is commit ed to continue strengthen ing climate security, including , by 
advocacy and dissemination of good environmental protection practices, 
management and risk reduction of natural disasters.  
 
23. These actions reinforce the role that His Excellency Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, 
President of the Republic of Mozambique , has been playing in his capacity 
as Champion of Disaster Risk Management in Africa, a mission assigned by the 
African Union.  
 
24. In this vein,  we call on the international community to join  our efforts , so that we 
continue to build resilience and adapt ation capacity to address the effects of 
climate change , in line with the commitments made in the Paris Agreement and 
the Sendai Framework.  
 
 
 
Mr President,  
Excellencies,  
 
 
2.  With regards to  consolidation of national peace and reconciliation, Mozambique 
has made remarkable progress in the process of disarmament, demobilization and 
reintegration (DDR) of former Renamo guerrillas.  
  
26. To date, 4,002 former Renamo guerrillas , of a total of 5,221 , have been covered 
by this process . We foresee , by the end of this year, the conclusion of the DDRprocess, which will be an important milestone in the implementation of the  
National Peace and  Reconciliation Agreement signed on 6 August 2019 between 
the G overnment of Mozambique and Renamo.  
 
27. With the completion of this stage , we will focus on long-term reintegration and 
more effective reconciliation, wchich is crucial to ensure the sustainability of the 
peace process and the consolidation of national unity . 
 
28. The remarkable progress we are making in the DDR  is due to the  valuable 
assistance and support by the United Nations  and the Contact Group. T he UN 
Secretary -General  also played an important role in this regard.  
 
29. Now, o n terrorism  - In order to prevent and combat terroris m in some districts of 
Cabo Delgado province, the Government of Mozambique has adopted a 
comprehensive approach that includes , strengthening the oper ational capacity of 
the Defence and Security Forces, stabilising security and creating conditions that 
enable recovery, reconstruction and socio -economic development, so that we can 
reduce the vulnerability of communities to violent extremism.  
 
30. Thanks to t he actions undertaken by Mozambique, combined with the support and 
assistance of multilateral and bilateral cooperation partners, including SADC, the 
European Union and Rwanda, we have made progress in combating terrorism.  
 
31. Mozambique's approach is a pioneer ing one,  in terms of concerted regional action 
to address the global threat of terrorism.  
 
32. The ongoing actions on the ground , are enabling the re establisment  of security 
and, consequently, the gradual return of the population to their areas of origi n and 
the resumption of economic and social activity in the regions previously affected 
by terrorist actions, and this, through the implementation of the Cabo Delgado 
Reconstruction Programme (PRCD).  
 
33. So, I wish to express our appreciation to all those who , directly or indirectly, have 
supported Mozambique in the preventi on and combat  against terrorism, in 
providing humanitarian assistance and in  rebuilding the economic and social fabric 
of the affected areas.  
 
 
Mr President , 
Excellencies ,34.  At the service of the Security Council as Non -Permanent Member  - I reaffirm 
Mozambique's commitmen t to the principles and  objectives of the United Nations . 
We will listen  and work  in close collaboration and coordination with all UN Member 
States.     
  
Thank tou for your kind attention !", MOZ,2022

Statement  Albania  
77th session UNGA 2022  
24 September 2022  
 
 
 
Mr. President,  
Distinguished  delegates ,  
 
It is a particular  honour for me to be here  
and speak  as the representative of a country 
that is currently serving in the Security 
Council. This respon sibility lends special 
importance to our role in this august body 
and beyond.  
 
We gather here each September  and 77 
years on, the UN has only gained in its 
universal appeal serving as  the parliament of humankind, the forum where we speak to 
each other  and listen to the world.   
 
Like no where else, the world converges 
here: we share  the success and progress ; 
outline  issues and challenges ; express worries 
and fears ; highlight crises and tension s; talk 
about agreements and discords, but above all, 
we bring a joint desire  for a better world .  
 
In these nearly eight decades, we have 
witnessed uninterrupted change, profound 
transformation, unprecedented mobilization, 
continued solidarity, and an all -time 
imperative of the need to work together . As a 
result, the wo rld has known  undeniable 
progress on many tracks .  
 
We must never forget that our journey 
has been bumpy . Many  times , we have also witnessed terrible setbacks and even reversal  
of progress.  Unfortunately , this is  mainly due 
to man -made catastrophes, ill-conceived 
policies, because of  narrow national politic s, 
short -sighted interests fuelled by populism, 
nationalism and greed for domination.   
 
This is why, this place at this time  each 
year , is the yearly check -up of the health of 
the world.    
 
We may sometim es have the impression 
that we say the same things, that we repeat 
each other. I would like to disagree.   
 
If committing to peace and security, to 
development and prosperity, to upholding 
the International Law and respecting human 
rights , engag e into genui ne efforts to mitigate climate change is repeating each other , then 
we are doing the right thing.  
 
Ladies and gentlemen ,  
 
Unfortunately, this year, our hopes and 
beliefs have been bitterly shattered and our 
assurances  were broken  by an unprovoked, 
unjust ified and premeditated war of one 
country against another, the brutal aggression 
of Russia against its neighbour, Ukraine.  
 
Russia’s war of choice is against Ukraine 
and its people; but not only, it is also an 
brutal assault  against International Law, a 
flagrant violation of the UN Charter and a 
direct threat to the European Security 
Architecture. It is open  battle between an aging cynical 
tyranny  and a young growing democracy.   
  
While we all, in our ways and with our 
respective means, try, individuall y and 
collectively, to project ourselves into the 
future ; one country , led by dreams of the 
grandeur of bygone times, has decided to 
drag the world backwards, go against 
everything we have built over decades .  
 
This is unacceptable.  
 
We will continue to s tand in full solidarity 
with Ukraine and  its people, and, just like 
some 40 other countries,  help them , in any 
way we can , to defend themselves.  
 
Their fight is also ours, and I hope , that of 
all Member s of the UN , that share the core principles of sovere ignty, of territorial 
integrity, of freedom and the right to 
independently decide on their  future , without 
fear or interference. Shying away from this 
defining battle between those principles and 
all their contrary is shying away from the duty 
to protect  ourselves, our countries, our 
children.  
 
While the world expects Russia to come to 
reason, stop the war and engage into peace 
negotiations, just a few days ago, Kremlin 
made another choice, that of escalation, 
announcing a partial mobilization which 
would deepen the conflict, bring more crimes, 
more victims , more misery  but also more 
shame on Russia itself .  
 
Sham referendums that are being 
conducted  in some parts of the occupied Ukrainian territory , with the threat of a gun . It 
is hard to imagine that anyo ne here can 
silently accept such disgraceful disregard of 
laws, rules, norms and practices that govern 
relations between states in the 21st Century.   
 
These actions run against international 
law and not only do not reflect  the free will of 
the Ukrainian p eople  but offer a miserable 
show of the detachment from everything that 
bring us together under the roof of the United 
Nations . We condemn such actions 
engineered in Moscow and will not recognize 
any such such unlawfulness.   
 
In the world we want, impunit y should 
not be the shelter of those who must  answer 
for their deeds. Albania is fully committed to 
accountability globally  and fight impunity 
everywhere. This is to provide justice to 
victims  but also to prevent future atrocities.  
 
That is why Albania calls and supports the  
work towards the adopt ion of a Convention 
on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes 
against Humanity. This new instrument  would 
fill a significant gap in the current 
international framework and facilitate 
international cooperatio n to protect civilians.  
 
Mr. Pres ident ,  
 
The world is never a quiet place and there 
are many serious challenges that need to be 
properly and immediately addressed. We face serious challenges with open conflict 
in many parts of the world .  
 
Many countries are subject to intolerable 
seizure of power by force .  
 
Terrorism remains a  serious  threat against 
peace and security .  
 
At a time when a multitude of crisis have put 
the world in turmoil including by 
unacceptable nuclear threats , I would like to  
call the attention of the Assembly on  another 
crucial issue closely linked and with huge 
impact on peace and security: cybersecurity.   
 
Technology is nowadays part of every 
aspect of our life  in Albania 95% of services to 
the citicens and business are offered onlin e. 
These user -friendly systems save time, energy, and drastically improve efficiency, 
quality and are the best tool to fighting 
corruption.  
 
Last July, Albania  was the target of an 
unprovoked large -scale cyberattack . The 
entire government digital infrastr ucture was 
under a sustained and coordinated assault, 
with the clear aim to destroy it, paralyze 
public services and steal data and electronic 
communications from government systems , 
create chaos and foment tension in the 
country .  
 
A lengthy and thorough in-depth 
investigation, conducted in cooperation with 
the best existing world expertise on cyber 
terrorism has now confirmed, beyond any 
doubt, that the cyberattack that wanted to 
bring a sovereign country to its knees, was a State -sponsored aggression , orchestrated and 
carried out by the Islamic Republic of Iran.  
 
This is why , in face of a such blatant 
breach  of norms  of responsible  State behavior 
in cyberspace in  peacetime, which include 
refraining from damaging critical 
infrastructure that provides serv ices to the 
public, the Government of Albania was left 
with no other choice but sever the 
diplomatic relations with Iran .  
 
We hope this forced extreme measure will 
be an example and a deterrent for anyone 
who supports or sponsors such abhorring 
actions ag ainst sovereign states . We urge the 
United Nations, including the Security 
Council, to focus more seriously and 
concretely to address cyber security by investing in prevention and help Member 
States build resilience . 
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
Albania is a M ember of the Balkans 
community, a part of Europe that has had its 
share of troubled history.  
 
Mention the word Balkans and I bet in 
everyone’s mind come the images stained by 
bloody wars and brutal crimes. You would 
rightfully recall the scars of repressi on and 
oppression, genocide in Srebrenica, and 
brutal ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Nothing of 
this is or will be forgotten.   
 
Accountability has and will continue and 
we must double our efforts to guarantee its 
unhindered course. This requires a resolved commitment to the ideals of justice and 
above all, cooperation between parties. 
Justice lies in the foundations of any effort for 
long -lasting peace, stability, and prosperity.  
 
But justice is served with facts, with proof 
and evidence, not with fiction or d istorted 
reality.  
 
Let me give you a terrible example: in 
2011, the Parliamentary Assembly of the 
Council of Europe adopted a report , compiled 
by a zealous parliamentarian, who goes by 
the name Dick Marty,  accusing the Kosovo 
Freedom fighters of the despi cable crime of 
organ trafficking.  
 
Mr Marty  should have been paid as a 
story teller , but never trusted as a 
rapporteur of the Council of Europe. His report was shocking and not only many 
believed it  then, but it became the key factor 
in establishing the K osovo specialist 
Chambers. It also became one of the worst 
cases of distorted reality, the kind of 
manifesto for worldwide propaganda against 
Kosovo independence.  
 
Every investigative effort  was made 
during these long 11 years to prove these 
allegations , nationally, regionally  and 
internationally. To no avail.   
 
Nothing, not a single shred of evidence or 
proof was found anywhere, in Kosovo or 
anywhere else regarding alleged trafficking of 
organs. Yet, the Kosovo Specialist Chambers  
that were founded based on that report, 
have, as we speak, arrested without 
indictment Kosova’s sitting president, Hashim Thaci . He waited a year in detention until he 
was formally indicted and guess what? Not a 
single word of the entire indictment has 
anything to do with the CoE  report on the 
alleged crime of organ trafficking. This is a 
monumental failure of international politics.   
 
This is not about a person; not about a 
court procedure. This is about taking of the 
undue stain on a country and it history.  
 
Nevertheless, exact ly because democracy 
and its institutions have, among many virtues, 
that of repairing their faults and errors, we 
strongly believe  that based on this crying lack 
of evidence whatsoever, the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe will honor 
the tru th and accept Albania’s request to 
produce a follow up report  and restore the credibility of such an important international 
organisation as the Council of Europe.  
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
I will say a few more words on the 
Wester n Balkans, not of the pas t but of the 
future, the one that we are working to build 
together.  
 
Turn this region in any way you want and 
you will find a lot of fuel for divisions and 
toxicity.  
 
But we in Albania have realised that the 
best way to advance is to do it together,  with  
shared benefits  as sovereign countries but 
close partners ; as national players joined by a 
common enterprise ; with our specific interests as part of a common framework , the 
one that responds to our citizens .  
 
This brought us together, with North 
Macedoni a and Serbia to launch the Open 
Balkans Initiative, a  platform open to all 
Balkan Counties,  from Montenegro to Kosovo, 
from Bosnia to Türkiye, Greece and further, 
an investment for everyone, as part of the 
wider common European project. The best 
message of  the Open Balkans is that you don’t 
need to agree on everything, but by build a 
common path to the future you also deal with 
disagreements. While strengthening its 
relations with Serbia and moving forward 
together to boost bilateral and regional 
cooperatio n, Albania has not and will not 
move an inch from it firm position in support 
of the need for every country that has not yet 
done so, including first and foremost Serbia, to recognize the Republic of Kosovo. It is high 
time to move beyond the current stale mate in 
the dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia , and 
work bravely towards a comprehensive peace 
agreement by doing their respective part to 
adopt a EU/US backed breakthrough.  
 
Dialogue is not just a better way; it is the 
sole and unique way to deal with is sues 
however difficult they appear;  however  
complex they are.  
 
I remain convinced that Open Balkans will 
only help facilitate this process to the benefit 
of all: Albanians and Serbs; Kosovo and 
Serbia, but also for the entire region and the 
wider Europe.  
 
Mr. President, Despite all the  worries and challenges that 
keep us awake at night, we should not lose 
hope, we should keep trying  and renew 
efforts in order to put  universality  at the 
heart of what we say and what we do at the 
national, regional,  and g lobal levels .  
 
More than ever, in today’s shaken world, 
we need to commit ourselves to our 
fundamental universal values and 
acknowledge that we constitute a community 
of fate, despite our different national 
perspectives and interests .  
 
Global warming wil l not distinguish 
between North and South , and the rise of the 
sea level will not stop at any shore. If the 
pandemic that shook the world to the core, 
has taught us anything, it is a very simple lesson, that no one is immune until everyone 
is.    
 
It is with this spirit that Albania acts in the 
region, in Europe,  including here, at the 
General Assembly  and in the Security Council , 
that the world expects rightfully to deliver, to 
stand up and save lives, to prevent and 
resolve conflict not to be paralyzed or held 
hostage.   
 
As an African Proverb about the value of 
Community  goes : “If you  want to  go fast , go 
alone . If you  want to  go far, go together. ”  
 
This is what we all need today, to solve 
collective problems through collective efforts  
and partnerships .  
 
Thank you", ALB,2022
VAT_77_2022,"Address by His Eminence Cardinal Pietro Parolin Secretary of State and Head of the Delegation of the Holy See at the General Debate of the High-Level Week at the Opening of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly New York, 24 September 2022  A WATERSHED MOMENT: TRANSFORMATIVE SOLUTIONS TO INTERLOCKING CHALLENGES  Mr. President, I am pleased to extend to you and to the Representatives of Nations gathered here the warm greetings of Pope Francis. It is good to be together again in person after the separation imposed upon us by the COVID-19 pandemic. When I addressed this preeminent gathering virtually last year, I spoke of the dark clouds hanging over humanity.1 A year later, while some of those clouds have lifted, other, darker clouds have gathered. Armed conflicts currently afflict our world to an extent not seen since 1945, with around two billion people living in conflict-affected areas and millions more forcibly displaced.2 In addition to the misery caused by violence and cruelty, and the anxiety arising from the threat of nuclear escalation, our world continues to face the challenges of climate change, mixed migration, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, while food insecurity and water scarcity now affect large portions of the global population. As the title of our general debate indicates, we stand at a watershed moment and together must seek “transformative solutions to the interlocking challenges we face”. No one can deny that “the great challenges of our time are all global.”3 At the same time “alongside the greater interconnection of problems, we are seeing a growing fragmentation of solutions […which] only fuels further tensions and divisions, as well as a generalized feeling of uncertainty and instability.”4 We can all identify with this observation, which Pope Francis made earlier this year. However, how then can we overcome that sense of “uncertainty and instability”?; Where to begin? First and foremost, we need to recover “our sense of shared identity as a single human family,” rooted in the inalienable dignity that we hold in common. If we do not  1 Cf. FRANCIS, Encyclical Letter, Fratelli Tutti, Chapter 1. 2 Data are from the SG’s remarks for the meeting of the Peacebuilding Commission on the report on Peacebuilding and Sustaining Peace, 30 March 2022. 3 FRANCIS, Address to the Members of the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See, 10 January 2022. 4 Ibid. focus on what unites us, seeking to promote the common good, there will only be “growing isolation, marked by a reciprocal rejection and refusal that […] endangers multilateralism”. 5 Indeed, it is here, at the Headquarters of the United Nations, the multilateral forum par excellence, that we are called to work together to restore, as Pope Francis requested, that “diplomatic style that has characterized international relations from the end of the Second World War.” 6 It is not merely a question of preserving the reputation of the institution, but rather making sure it is best able to implement its foundational charter and respond to the challenges faced by humanity. Mr. President, When Pope Saint Paul VI visited this chamber on the twentieth anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations, his heartfelt plea was broadcast around the world: “jamais plus la guerre, jamais plus la guerre!”7 – “no more war, no more war!” Alas, decades later, the hard-fought progress this institution achieved in the past century in reducing the prevalence of armed conflict globally has been questioned in recent years. This reversal deeply concerns the Holy See. Speaking of the post-Second World War consensus that understood the need to “lay the foundations of a new era of peace,” Pope Francis recognized that “unfortunately—we never learn [and] the old story of competition between the greater powers continue[s].” In short, the perennial logic of self-interest prevails—seeking to extend economic, ideological and military influence.8 And yet, the Holy See strongly believes in multilateralism and the irreplaceable role of the United Nations. For that reason, Pope Francis, in line with his predecessors, speaks repeatedly in support of this Organization, while at the same time encouraging a process of renewal, and calling on Governments to heed the plea of those countries and peoples, who suffer most from the consequences of its current limitations.9 Mr. President, This General Assembly has been working on the revitalization of various aspects of its work for some time.10 This effort reflects a healthy instinct, for, as time passes, all institutions need to examine themselves in light of their foundational principles, missions, and mandates. For the United Nations, this process takes place against the backdrop of a crisis of credibility, arising not only from its apparent impotence in times of crisis, but also from the promotion of agenda in many fora that frequently shift the focus “to matters that by their divisive nature do not strictly belong to the aims of the Organization.”11 In fact, these agenda express a “reject[ion of] the natural foundations of humanity and the cultural roots that constitute the identity of many peoples.”12 Pope Francis has called this “ideological colonization”. Unfortunately, in the day-to-day running of the United Nations, key decisions are now “frequently made without a genuine  5 Ibid 6 Ibid 7 PAUL VI, Speech to the United Nations Organization on its 20th Anniversary, 4 October 1965. 8 Cf. FRANCIS, General Audience, 6 April 2022. 9 Cf. FRANCIS, Address to the UN General Assembly, 25 September 2015. 10 https://www.un.org/en/ga/revitalization/revital_bkg.shtml 11 Cf. FRANCIS, Address to the Members of the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See, 10 January 2022. 12 Cf. Ibid process of negotiation in which all countries have a say.”13 This is at odds with the true nature of multilateral diplomacy, which “cherish[es] the differences and sensibilities that have historically marked various peoples.”14 The revitalization process must restore focus to those common aims outlined in the UN Charter: peace and security, human rights, and development. There remains much work to be done in this regard. Unfortunately, international cooperation is hindered by the flagrant imposition of contentious policies which do not enjoy agreement, particularly in the area of human rights. In this regard, there appears to be little desire on the part of specific States to recover the broad ground and humility that is necessary for consensus and authentic dialogue. Indeed, today it would appear that only the powerful and the well-funded prevail, reinventing human rights as they see fit and using them to reshape the world and the human person in their own image and ideas of radical autonomy. Instead, the fundamental human rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are not “niche” or competing, nor are they determined by the reactionary winds of mass media and culture.  Human rights are rather firmly rooted in universal values, such that the right to life, to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, opinion and expression are not undermined, and that the institution of the family, which remains the original cell of social life15 and the “primordial school of humanity”16, is protected. Today, the Holy See reaffirms, once again, that human rights remain universal, objective and firmly rooted in the God given dignity of the human person. It is imperative that broad agreement and genuine consensus be found again soon within this Organization if it is to restore its international credibility as a true family of nations.  It must extend beyond the General Assembly, to the reform of those organs with “effective executive capability, such as the Security Council.”17 The landmark resolution, agreed by consensus in April of this year, requiring that the use of veto power be explained before the General Assembly, was a welcome step in this direction.18 The members of the Security Council, most especially the Permanent Members, hold a crucial responsibility for the maintenance of peace and order in the world. When there is no shared vision or political will for peaceful coexistence, and the very guardians of peace ignore the rules they claim to uphold, they become themselves the perpetrators of grave injustices. Driven by unbridled self-interest and determined by the logic of power, the system is heavily damaged and at risk. Only when the Representatives of nations gathered here are able to place the common good above their own partisan interests, will the legal framework of the United Nations’ System truly “be the pledge of a secure and happy future”.19  At present, however, that future remains elusive for a large part of the human family. Violence continues to scar our world; the devastation that war wreaks directly upon the populations of conflict zones is compounded by the indirect impact on countless  13 Ibid. 14 Ibid. 15 Cf. Universal Declaration of human Rights, which recognizes the family as “the natural and fundamental group unit of society” (Art. 16). 16 Cf.

FRANCIS, Address to the UN General Assembly, 25 September 2015. 18 Resolution A/77/L.52. 19 FRANCIS, Address to the UN Office at Nairobi, 26 November 2015. other people far from the frontline. As Pope Francis has pointed out, “war diverts attention and resources, but these are the objectives that demand the utmost commitment: the fight against hunger, health, and education.”20 World hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms are alarmingly on the rise. Figures reveal that the world is moving away from the target set to be reached by 2030.21 In fact, future projections indicate that around 8% of the world's population will still face food shortages. The number of people suffering hunger in the world has risen to as many as 828 million in 2021. However, expenditure on arms, today at obscene levels, only serves to increase food insecurity, restrict access to healthcare - already in crisis on account of the COVID-19 pandemic - and deprive generations of their rightful education. It is time to bring an end to “armament hypocrisy” — speaking of peace and living off weapons.22 Instead of squandering vast sums on military equipment, it would be far wiser to invest in avoiding war, rather than preparing for it. In this regard, education should be a priority, for it “is in fact the primary vehicle of integral human development, for it makes individuals free and responsible.”23 With COVID-19 having already disrupted the education of millions of students, there is urgent need for targeted investments to put ourselves back on track toward a brighter future. Mr. President, The war in Ukraine has exacerbated already concerning global trends, including rising food and fuel prices and increased displacement. The conflict has also brought renewed attention to nuclear security and the risk of nuclear escalation, an issue that has remained largely outside the public consciousness for decades. Even before the war in Ukraine, drought and crop failure in various parts of the world had disrupted access to food for millions especially the world’s poorest, many of whom are unable to access or afford basic foodstuffs. With the onset of conflict, a key source of staple grains and cooking oil for countries that rely on food imports was interrupted, placing millions more at risk of food insecurity and starvation. Additionally, the war has also exposed the vulnerability of short-sighted energy policies that rely exclusively on a single source of fossil fuel, rather than developing clean and sustainable alternatives. As always in times of crisis, it is the poorest among us who suffer the most. As winter approaches in the northern hemisphere, many living in colder climates will face an existential choice between heating and eating. Addressing these crises—which can only be resolved fully once the violence in Ukraine ceases—requires urgent and concerted action. Furthermore, the war in Ukraine not only undermines the nuclear non-proliferation regime, but also presents us with the danger of nuclear devastation, either through escalation or accident. First, the spectacle of a nuclear-weapon State at war with a State that renounced its nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees that have been blatantly disregarded will discourage other States that possess nuclear weapons  20 FRANCIS, Angelus, 14 August 2022 – with reference to the threat of drought-induced famine in Somalia. 21 The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) 2022. 22 Cf. FRANCIS, Interview on return flight from Apostolic Journey to Thailand and Japan, 26 November 2019. 23 FRANCIS, Message for the 2022 World Day of Peace, 3. from following suit, complicating the path toward a world free of nuclear weapons. Second, any threat of nuclear weapons use is repugnant and merits unequivocal condemnation. Third, the Holy See has been following the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant with deep concern and recalls that Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions prohibits attacks against nuclear electrical generating stations if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces that threaten civilian populations. To avoid a nuclear disaster, it is vital that there be serious engagement to find a peaceful outcome to the conflict. In this context, the regrettable lack of an outcome document at the 10th Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty comes as no surprise. In the meantime, Europe’s largest refugee crisis since the Second World War only adds to the millions throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Asia who have been forced to flee their country of origin because of conflict and war in search of a better future for themselves and their families. On top of this, many more are driven to leave their homes due to hunger, poverty and the effects of climate change. Mixed migration is a global phenomenon, which needs to be addressed accordingly. In this regard, implementing the vision and objectives of both the Global Compact for Safe, Regular, and Orderly Migration (GCM), as well as the Global Compact on Refugees, remain among the best ways to encourage the international cooperation and burden sharing. At the same time, States, with the help of the international community, must continue to fulfill their obligations to their citizens. This includes making every effort to generate the necessary conditions for people to live in peace, security and dignity in their countries of origin.  Today, the framework of international laws and agreements providing protection to refugees and upholding the human rights of migrants, regardless of status, is under significant strain. Mixed flows are notoriously difficult to manage. Without a sincere effort made to update the current international protection system, asylum system and the various legal instruments that govern Search and Rescue in this regard, the current chaos that continues to result in countless acts of violence, abuse and increasing loss of life will only get worse. Mr. President,  The Holy See does not cease to follow with concern the Palestinian issue, and the conflict that it generates, and wishes to express its closeness to the Palestinian people for the suffering caused by the killing of the journalist Shireen Abu Akleh during the firefight between the Israeli army and some Palestinians on 11 May in Jenin (Palestine), which the journalist was simply documenting. The Holy See not only deplores in clear terms this and the other killings that have been on the increase in recent months, but it cannot fail to express its horror at what happened at the funeral of the deceased Shireen in Jerusalem, provoked by an unacceptable and absolutely reprehensible attitude on the part of the police: dignity and respect for a deceased person precedes any consideration of security, and those who fail in this cannot be in charge of public order.   In closely following the situation in Lebanon, the Holy See hopes that the country, even with the upcoming presidential elections, will continue on the path of rebirth while remaining faithful to its vocation of being a land of peace. On the other hand, the Holy See welcomes that the parties to the conflict in Yemen have agreed to renew the truce brokered by the United Nations and it is hoped that this sign of hope will be a definitive step towards ending the bloody conflict that has generated one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The Holy See hopes that the resumption of negotiations in Vienna on the Iran Nuclear Agreement in the framework of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – JCPOA - will ensure a safer and more fraternal world. The Holy See follows with great concern the stalemate in Libya and the consequent security risks. The country continues to be divided internally by conflicting factions. This situation has an adverse impact on refugees and migrants, who are among the most vulnerable.  We continue to be concerned about the deterioration of the humanitarian and the security situation in the Sahel region, which continues to be targeted by terrorist groups, and the expansion of this violence towards Western Africa, with attacks perpetrated in Benin and in Togo. The people across the region also are becoming more and more vulnerable due to increasing food insecurity, the multiplication of climate emergencies, as well as the pandemic. The Holy See continue to be concerned about inter-community conflicts in the African continent, generated by different factors, and that run through many countries, often revealing a lack of efficiency of State structures in meeting the real needs of the population. Among these, the Holy See follows with concern the violence and armed clashes in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which generate instability throughout the region, and the still tense situation in parts of Ethiopia, where the general humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate.  The Holy See continues to follow the political transitions currently underway in Sudan, Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea, with the hope that these will be brought to a speedy conclusion for the common good of all the citizens of the respective countries. The precarious humanitarian condition in South Sudan is continually worsened due to flooding and food insecurity for a significant portion of the population, especially where children suffer malnutrition. The Holy See, while continuing to follow the situation on the youngest nation closely, continues to promote reconciliation through dialogue and social cooperation. The Holy See is deeply concerned about the delicate situation in Nicaragua, which involves both people and institutions. It hopes that a path can be found towards respectful and peaceful coexistence. The repeated episodes of violence in Haiti, which have aggravated the suffering of the population, already suffering because of its precarious economic and social conditions remain of great concern to the Holy See. The Holy See, saddened by the recent fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia, urged the parties to respect the ceasefire in view of a peace agreement. On a more positive note, the Holy See welcomes the results announced regarding the hoped-for production of a vaccine against malaria, which is the main cause of death in Africa. This merits a joint effort to make it accessible to all in need. Mr. President, Our common home continues to be gravely affected by the adverse impacts of climate change. Indeed, we have grown so used to hearing of extreme weather events, including flooding, drought and wildfires, that we may be left in a state of “globalized indifference”.24 And yet those phenomena are clear signs of our failure to address climate change, notwithstanding the overwhelming scientific evidence. Moreover, multilateral environmental agreements have already laid out obligations for States Parties that would prove effective in tackling the threat posed by climate change. It is now up to each State Party to honor the obligations incumbent upon them and to implement such agreements. In this regard, when the international community gathers at COP2725 in Sharm El Sheikh it is to be hoped that there will be the political will to take more decisive and transformative decisions to protect the environment by accelerating global climate action through stronger mitigation measures, scaled-up adaptation efforts and enhanced flows of appropriate finance. On this issue, I am pleased to note that the Holy See, acting in the name and on behalf of the Vatican City State, has recently deposited the instruments of accession both to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and to the Paris Agreement, and will thus become a party to both prior to COP27. With this step, the Holy See affirms its intention to contribute to the efforts of all States to work together in solidarity, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, to respond effectively to challenges posed by climate change. The digital environment also demands greater attention, given the increasingly important role that information and communication technologies (ICTs) play in our daily lives. While recognizing the new opportunities for intercultural exchange, learning, and innovation created by ICTs, we should also be aware of the digital gaps between and within countries, particularly developing countries. Digital connectivity cannot be achieved without addressing poverty and underdevelopment. Additionally, the growth in the use of ICTs brings new risks, as bad actors find new ways to misuse these technologies for criminal purposes. As Pope Francis points out, “the potential of digital technology is enormous, yet the possible negative impact of its abuse in the area of human trafficking, the planning of terrorist activities, the spread of hatred and extremism, the manipulation of information and […] in the area of child abuse, is equally significant. Public opinion and lawmakers are finally coming to realize this.”26 In this regard, the Holy See continues to be engaged constructively in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of ICTs for Criminal Purposes to address transnational crime. Recognizing that interlocking challenges require a unified response, Pope Francis reminds us that “today more than ever, everything is deeply connected and that the safeguarding of the environment cannot be divorced from ensuring justice for the poor  24 FRANCIS, Encyclical Letter, Fratelli Tutti, 30. 25 27th Session of the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC. 26 FRANCIS, Address to participants in the Congress on Child Dignity in the Digital World, 14 November 2019. and finding answers to the structural problems of the global economy.”27 This is at the heart of his call for a different and responsible economic practice, recognizing that authentic human development has a moral character. It presumes full respect for the human person, man, woman, girl, boy, but it must also be concerned for the world around us and “‘take into account the nature of each being and of its mutual connection in an ordered system.’ Accordingly, our human ability to transform reality must proceed in line with God’s original gift of all that is.”28 Mr. President, At this watershed moment, our quest for solutions must start with a reaffirmation of the inalienable dignity that unites us. It underpins all that we are and do, enabling us to speak of our belonging to the one human family. A recognition of this reality is the first, vital step we need to take to begin transforming any crisis into a new opportunity. This is the logic of the appeal Pope Francis addressed to the Heads of Nations and international organizations calling on them to work together for peace, “not a peace based on the balance of weapons, [or] on mutual fear,”29 but rather one born of encounter and dialogue. For this, “it is necessary to pass from the strategies of political, economic and military power to a plan for global peace: no to a world divided among conflicting powers; yes to a world united among peoples and civilizations that respect each other.”30 That is the truly transformative solution that together we are called to make reality in and through this Organization. Thank you, Mr. President.

By H.E.  Pham Binh Minh, First Deputy Prime Minister of Viet Nam  
At the General Debate of the 77th Session  
of the United Nations General Assembly  
 (New York,  24 September 202 2) 
 
Strengthening  international solidarity and partnerships   
- key to ad dressing interlocking global challenges  
 
Mr. President,  
1. I join others in co ngratulating you on your election as  President 
of the 7 7th Session of the General Assembly.  As Vice -President , Viet 
Nam has full confidence in your able leadership and guidance , and will 
work with you  to steer the work of t he Assembly to success .  
I thank  Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the 7 6th Session, for his 
important contributions to the work of the General Assembly , and to 
Secretary -General An tónio Guterres for the leadersh ip and innovation  
instille d in the Organization over the past year . 
Mr. President,  
2. We are at a watershed moment in history.   
Confrontation,  conflicts  and violations of international law  
continue to intensify, mirroring great power competition  and 
unilat eralism.  
Global military expenditure surged to a record high 2.1 trillion 
USD , while the international community fail to mobilize  100 billion 
USD for climate actions .  
The nuclear risk reaches  its highest point in decades. But that was 
still not enough fo r the NPT review conference to achieve any collective 
commitment to action . The outbreak of armed conflicts  and hightened tension, especially 
between major powers, have made the international security cl imate  
more volatile than at any point since the Cold  War.  
The climate crisis  and other non -traditional security risks threaten 
our very existence.   
The Covid -19 pandemic have wreaked  havoc on health systems, 
economies and societi es worldwide . Poverty, inequalities, violence and 
exclusion are denying the rights of millions to the basic necessities of 
life. With less than a decade to go, the Sustainable Development Goals 
are even further off track .  
Facing these multiple crises,  developing countries and vulnerable 
groups , wh o lack the capacity , resources and resilience to cope with 
external shocks , are those hardest hit.  
3. To reverse this  course , we must  fundamentally change our ways 
of thinking and doing things . This entails reshaping a global approach to 
address  global issues, enhancing resilience and placi ng people at the 
core of all development efforts . 
And key to such an approach is international solidarity and 
partnerships at all levels.  
We know this from our own history. International solidarity has 
been crucial for the success of Viet Nam's national l iberation a nd 
reunification. Multilateraliz ation and diversification of partnerships , 
meanwhile, have proven indispensable in Viet Nam’s foreign policy of 
independence, self -reliance, peace, cooperation and development.  
They have opened the door  for Viet Nam  to the world, and helped 
bring catalystic  resources to propel Viet Nam’s Doi moi  renovation 
process . They have helped  improved the lives  tens of mil lions of 
Vietnamese and brought prosperity to a formerly war -torn country, and 
now confidently  on a path  to become a developed, high -income  country  
by 2045 . But I believe the experience of Viet Nam is not an exception . 
There  is an abunda nce of stories about how solidarity  and partnerships 
triumph over mistrust and fragmentations , and bring about positive 
change.   
Mr. President,  
4. As we move forwar d in the spirit of solidarity and partnerships , I 
wish to underline four key points : 
First,  a confrontational and zero -sum game approach must be 
eliminated. Imposition , intervention  and unilateral  acts have no pla ce in 
the good conduct of international affairs . Major powers  are particularly  
looked upon to behave re sponsibly, and work for the common good and 
not their own selfish interests .  
Viet Nam calls for strengthened multilateralism and international 
cooperati on in the spirit of openness, inclusiveness, equality and mutual 
benefit. Major UN and international agendas , especially the 2030 
Agenda  and climate actions, must  not be put on hold  due to isolated  
disagreements among countries. We must  stay focused on our  common 
goals and responsibilities . 
We stand in firm solidarity with the people of Cuba and call for the 
immediate lifting of the unilateral embargoes against Cuba contrary to 
international law.  
Second , our actions, both individually and collectively, must  be 
guided by and in accordance with  international law and the UN Charter . 
Viet Nam firmly believes that respect for international law, 
especially vis-à-vis the respect for sovereign equality, political 
independence and territorial integrity of states , the peaceful settlement of 
disputes, is the  most effective  and viable  measure to  prevent conflicts 
and promote  sustainable peace and security.  
Constructive dialogue  and respect for  the legitimate rights and 
interests of  all parties , in accordance with inter national law,  are key in 
resolving differences and reducing tensions . Viet Nam calls for the cessation of hostilities in Ukraine, and 
stands ready to contribute  to the diplomatic process , and the 
reconstruction and rehabilitation of Ukraine.  
Third, we need strong and eff ective multilateral institutions , with 
the UN at the heart , to best address global challenges. They are best 
positioned to  initiate  and incubate  transformative  ideas  approaches and 
solutions , and  to forge  partnerships  and mobilize resources  for the 
implementation of those initiatives.   
Viet Nam  welcome s the forward -looking proposals  in the  
Secretary -General’s  “Our Common Agenda” report . We will engage 
actively in the deliberation  of these proposals, and in the preparations of 
the Summit of the  Future and the  SDG Summit . We have high hopes 
these Summits will provide concrete, meaningful and long -lasting  
commitment and actions .  
Fourth, regional organizations can pioneer and play a prominent 
role in bolstering multilateral cooperation . 
In South E ast Asia, ASEAN is doing its part to help address  
regional and global issues. We are working to  build a strong an d united 
ASEAN Community and  advance  the central role of ASEAN in the 
regional security architecture . Building  a broad  and extensive network of  
partnerships, ASEAN has created a premier forum for strategic dialogue  
engaging important partners of the region, especially  with major powers.  
ASEAN is working hard to implement  the Five -Point Conse nsus to help 
find comprehensive soluti ons to the situati on in Myanmar.    
Viet Nam  underline s the need for maintaining peace, stability, 
maritime safety an d security in the South China Sea , and call on  all 
parties  to resolve disputes by peaceful means, with ful l respect for  legal 
and diplomatic processes . We cal l on parties to exercise self -restraint, 
refrain from unilateral activities and attempts to change t he status quo, 
and not to  threat en or use  force, in accordance with international law 
including the UN Charter and UNCLOS 1982. Mr. President,  
 5. This ye ar Viet Nam celebrates its 45th year as a member of the 
United Nations. Since that Septembe r day in 1977, the UN has been a 
trusted friend and reliable partner , standing with us in our most difficult 
times  of post-war reconstruction  and more recently im th e fight against 
COVID -19, and accompanying us on our path of Doi moi  renovation, 
improving our people ’s lives and advancing the country’s development.  
 Welcoming Viet Nam to the United Nations 45 years ago,  
President of the 32nd Session of the General Asse mby highlighted Viet 
Nam ’s dedication to the purposes and principles and affirmed that, and  I 
quote, “The admission of Viet Nam marks a further step towards 
consolidating peace and security in the world ”, end of quote.  
45 years on and these statements rem ain valid. Viet Nam’ s history 
and its vision for the future has always been intimately  linked with the 
aspirations for  peace  and development . We have consistently supported 
and pursued a balanced and constructive approach  in seeking lasting 
solutions to global issues.  
As member of major  UN bodies, most recently the Security 
Counc il, Viet Nam has consistently  underlined the importance to uphold  
the UN Charter and to ensure that  the UN best serves the needs  and 
interests  of all members.  
Our men and women ar e proudly serving  in UN peacekeeping 
missions in South Sudan , Abyei  and Cent ral African Republic .  
Viet Nam is sparing no effort to realize our commitment to achiev e 
net-zero emissions by 2050 , an ambit ious goal given the level of 
development and technolog y capacity of Viet Nam .  
At the Human Rights Council, Viet Nam has consistently worked 
to advance mutual understanding  and respect , foster dialogue and 
cooperation. We lead efforts to promot e the rights of vulnerable groups in  
the context of climate change . And now we are  aspir ing a seat  at the  Human Rights Council for 
the term 2023 -2025 . I hope we can  count on your valuable support , just as 
you can count on us as a reliable , responsible  and constructive  partner in 
the promotion  and protection  of all  huma n rights, for all.  
Mr. President,  
In unity  there is strength , with solidarity  and partnerships  there  is 
power .  
Let us all work  toget her in unity,  solidarity  and a spirit  of 
partnership  to surmount  the interlocking  challenges  we all are facing  
together,  in this watershed  moment , for the sake of sustainable  peace  and 
development in the world . 
I thank you, Mr. President ./.", VNM,2022

 Mr. President,  
 I would like to begin by e xtend ing my sincere congratulations to His 
Excellency  Csaba Korosi  on his election  as President of the 77th Session of the 
United Nations General Assembly. I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Lao 
PDR in this august Assembly.  
Mr. President,  
We are at a critical juncture  when  the international community is facing multi -
faceted challenges  ranging from armed conflicts  to environmental crises  and 
economic down turn that setback global development . Multilateralism , which is 
alwa ys at the heart of  international cooperation , has been  undermined while 
unilateral ism has been applied widely . These challenges , already exacerbated by 
the pandemic , have hindered and reversed the development gains attained during  
past decade s. The implementation of the SDGs has never before been so tarnished. 
It is disheartening that the most vulnerable peoples and countries are now suffering 
the most . Countries in special situations namely the LDCs, LLDCs  and SIDS which 
have  endur ed the most  difficult period  coping with Covid -19 impacts , are 
additionally confronting climate , food and energy crises . It is more alarming than 
ever for the international community to find  solutions , not only  transformative , but 
also more practical,  effective,  action -oriented, sustainable  and tailored to the most 
pressing  needs , so the most vulnerable are not left behind . 
Mr. President,  
Seventy -seven years after our United Nations was fo rmed , we shall no longer  
be here in this august assembly to stage a ny claim , lecture , blame or shame one 
another . Our world needs  greater attention,  concerted efforts and common desire. 
“We”, as stipulated in the Charter, are  the people s of the United Nations . We shall  
gather here to find the most appropriate solutions and take the most urgent  actions 
to address the problems  we are all facing today . This cannot be done without firmly 
upholding the principles of the UN Charter and preserv ing multilateralism . Our 
United Nations was fo unded to prevent another catastrophic world war. Our shared 
wisdom and political will to find the most pragmatic  and suitable  solutions  to 
multiple crises threatening us all  today must lie on top of other individual ( unilateral ) 
interests . In doing so, w e must  strengthen our solidarity , cooperation  and 
collaboration  and must not create  confrontation and division.  As such, it isPage 3 of 5 
 necessary, after more than seven decades, that the UN reform  revitaliz es and 
increase s its ability to  effectively address  global problems .  
In this context , the United Nations needs to effectively fulfill  its mandate in 
maintaining international peace and security  as well as in promoting development 
cooperation. It is our common desire that the United Nations be transformed  in order 
to respond  to the current global landscape and needs , in our joint effort to overcome 
the unfold ing challenges which threaten international peace and development . The 
international community must find peaceful and lasting resolution s to any conflict 
and disputes around the world, including  the Middle East problem . We believe that 
unilateral sanction or measures cannot be effective as it is not only contravened to 
the principles of the Charter of the United Nations  and international law, but also 
hampers the national development of other  countries. Sanctions  regardless of their 
forms will only end up compromising one’s own interest as well as those of other 
and inflicts suffering on everyone. We must also give more opportunities to peaceful 
resolutions based on our mutual interests and build an environment conducive to 
developme nt so as to safeguard the lasting peace and prosperity for all. In this regard , 
my delegation once again joins an overwhelming global call for lifting of the 
economic embargo on  Cuba  and putting an end to all unilateral coercive measures , 
which have caused more negative impact s on the innocent people.  
Mr. President,   
ASEAN  has enjoyed long lasting peace, security and stability, which served 
as favorable condition s for the national socio -economic development of all Member 
States. We in ASEAN, continue to promote regionalism and multilateralism that 
emphasize the importan ce of centrality, unity, inclusivity, mutual benefit and 
respect, which form a solid foundation in all essential frameworks of cooperation in 
ASEAN. The Lao PDR has actively participated and contributed with great 
responsibility under the framework of ASEAN to promote peace and stability . On 
this note , the Lao PDR considers the role played by  ASEAN  as crucial in creating 
an environment conducive to a return to normalcy in Myanmar  and we should 
continue to engage Myanmar so as to ensure the continuation of delivery of 
humanitarian assistance to the people of Myanmar  and to explore ways and means 
to ensure Myanmar’s full and effective implementation of the Five -Point Consensus 
towards tangible outcomes.  
Mr. President,Page 4 of 5 
 Since the inception of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, 
the Government  of the Lao  PDR  has presented two Voluntary National Reviews in 
2018 and 2021, reflecting progress  made and challenges encountered  in the 
implementation of SDGs  through the National Socio -Economic Development Plan s, 
and 2030 Vision and Green Growth Strategy.  
 
Nevertheless, throughout the past 3 years, the COVID -19 pandemic has 
imposed  direct impacts on socio -economic development of every country, especially 
least developed countries, including the Lao PDR. Therefore, t he progress made 
prior to COVID -19 in the implementation of our national development and 
international commitments, like SDGs and others, ha s been severely undermined , 
affecting  the livelihood  of the people  in all dimensions .  
 
In addition, we are also facing extreme weather events due to climate change 
in different parts of the world. Like many other countries, the Lao PDR remains 
vulnerable to external shocks and has been severely affected by natural disasters 
especially extensive floodings. Over the years , our government has attached great 
importance to combating climate change through the implementation of the revised 
Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) that clearly outlines ambitious targets 
of the national actions for tackling and mitigating climate change towards achieving 
net-zero emissions by 2050.  To this end, there is pressing need for adequate financial 
resources and technical support  for gaining access to climate finance and other 
sources of funding to support developing countries, especially LDCs, LLDCs and 
SIDS to achieve their development goals and commitments made under the Paris 
Agreement.  In this regard, we  call for renewed politica l will coupled with concrete 
actions taken by the international community  in the upcoming COP 27  to preserve 
our planet for many generations to come.  
Mr. President,  
Having recognized multidimensional challenges and special needs of group 
of countries in special situations, the Lao PDR is strongly committed to the 
implementation of the internationally agreed development goals and  Programmes 
of Action for LDCs, LLDCs  and other UN development cooperation frameworks. 
The Lao PDR remains  hopeful a nd firmly believes that m ultilateralism with the 
United Nations as a lead institution, the multiple crises and challenges the 
international community is facing  can be appropriately addressed . We are stronglyPage 5 of 5 
 committed to supporting conflict resolution s through peaceful means , guided by the 
UN Charter and other relevant international laws. We trust that development 
cooperation for common interests  and shared benefits must continue to be  at the core 
of international relations.  Towards this end, more action -oriented solutions and non-
politicized  approaches  must be adopted . It is our hope that this  UNGA 77  will offer 
the opportunities to enhance our solidarity  and revive sustainab le develop ment path s 
in order for us to ensure transformative solutions for better livelihoods of our peoples 
and planet .   
Last but not least, I would like to  express, on behalf of the Lao Government 
and people,  my sincere appreciations to all member states for kind support for our 
membership of the ECOSOC , for the term 2023 -2025. We stand ready to humbl y 
serve and make meaningful contribut ion to the work of the ECOSOC and we pledge 
to discharge our duties in “ advancing partnership toward s a more resilient and 
sustainable world”.  
Thank you.",LAO,2022

Statement  
by 
H.E. Mr. Don Pramudwinai   
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Thailand  
 
 
 
 
at the General Debate  
of the 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly  
 
 
 
 
24 September 2022, UNHQ, New York 
 Mr. President,  
Distinguished delegates,  
 
1.  I would like at the outset to extend my warmest congratulations for your ele ction 
as President of the seventy -seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly 
and congratulations go to your entire team of the presidency.  Please rest assured of 
Thailand’s full support as you undertake to fulfil l your important mission.  
 
2.  We are at the watershed moment, as an international community and as the United 
Nations. We stand at a point where the decisions we make and the actions we pursue 
can shape the world and shape the course of humanity for years to come. But we can 
only do it t ogether, guided by our shared interests and based on mutual respect.  
 
3. The  COVID -19 pandemic  has only exacerbated  the inequality gaps and it has 
reversed at least four years of development gains, according to the UNDP. And at a 
time when the world is trying to recover from the two years of the pandemic, our 
problems are co mpounded with multiple challenges.  
 
4. We are seeing new conflicts on top of global geopolitical tensions. We are 
experiencing the food crisis, the energy crisis and the financing crisis. These have 
had the most detrimental impact on those who are most v ulnerable that is LDCs and 
SIDS, and vulnerable groups such as women, girls, the elderly and people with 
disabilities. Collective action is needed now. 
 Overcoming Crises and Challenges  
 
Mr. President,  
 
5. The food crisis has affected us all. As one of t he world’s leading exporters of food 
and agricultural products, Thailand has not been spared from the effects of 
skyrocketing prices of animal feed, fertilisers and consumer food. This global food 
insecurity stems from conflicts, climate change, disruption  to supply chain and 
uneven recovery from COVID -19.  
 
6. There is thus an urgent need to strengthen multilateral action among like -minded 
partners, United Nations agencies, WTO and international institutions in facilitating 
a constructive dialogue a nd improving policy coordination to address this crisis. It 
is suddenly vital to keep our global supply chains open for seamless cross -border 
flows of food, fertilisers, and essential goods, while also making our food systems 
more resilient so that equitab le access to safe and healthy food for all can be 
guaranteed. Thailand is prepared to work in partnership with countries and 
international organisations to realise that vision.  
 
7. In this context, Thailand welcomes the Black Sea Grain Initiative establ ished by 
the United Nations to open a safe corridor for grain transportation that would help 
ease a global food crisis. This initiative further stresses the importance of 
international cooperation under the UN’s framework in order to respond to new 
global challenges.  
 
8. In addition to overcoming food insecurity, we also need to overcome health 
insecurity. As we learnt from the pandemic, good health for all is critical. And that’s 
 why ‘Universal Health Coverage’ should be a high priority for us all. We need to 
ensure ac cess to quality essential health -care services and access to safe, effective, 
quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for everyone. We must 
continue to promote and protect the right to the highest attainable standard of health, 
as part of our commitment to human rights. We must continue to invest in promoting 
a more inclusive social protection system for all, as called for by the Secretary -
General in the “Our Common Agenda” report.  
 
9. To reinforce this, the global health archite cture needs to be reformed, both 
structurally and functionally, to address the current shortcomings and systemic 
failures of health systems. And that’s why Thailand fully supports the development 
of a legally  binding  international  instrument  on pandemic pr evention, 
preparedness, and response under the WHO. The new instrument must place ‘equity’ 
at its heart to ensure ‘self -reliance’ of developing countries when faced with 
pandemics, especially through enhancing their capacity to manufacture certain 
medical countermeasures.  
 
Putting the Sustainable Development Goals Back on Track  
 
10. With better food and health security, we will be better positioned to putting the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) back on track.  In doing so, a human rights -
based  approach is needed to ensure that the rights and basic needs of all persons are 
guaranteed, especially the rights and needs of those most vulnerable and furthest 
behind. This will help enhance our resilience and capacity to cope with future crises. 
SDGs s erve both as the pathway, and the end goal, in ensuring survival of our present 
and future generations. 
 11. As we have only eight years left to attain the SDGs, we need to employ every 
tool at our disposal from science, technology and innovation to work ing in 
partnership at every level to drive this agenda forward. Because without sustainable 
development, there is no future. We need to promote North -South and South -South 
cooperation and the integration of the 2030 Agenda with other cooperation 
frameworks , both at the global and regional levels. That’s way ESCAP and ASEAN 
are working to enhance the complementarity between the 2030 Sustainable 
Development Agenda and the 2025 ASEAN Vision.  Thailand’s hosting  of the Global  
South -South Development Exp o with ESCAP and the United Nations Office for 
South -South Cooperation (UNOSSC) in Bangkok last week also demonstrates the 
importance we place on development cooperation, especially among developing 
countries.  
 
12. Furthermore, financing for development and finding innovative sources of 
finance is key to the transforming SDGs from mere aspiration to reality for all. 
Thailand agrees with the Secretary -General’s proposal in promoting cooperation 
with leading global  financial institutions to mobilise finance to drive forward the 
SDGs while improving financial liquidity for least developed countries.  
 
13. And to promote sustainable development, Thailand has adopted the Bio -
Circular -Green Economy Model (BCG) as a me ans to achieve a more balanced 
development in this recovery phase. The BCG Economy Model utilises science, 
technology and innovation to encourage the optimization of resources for 
environmentally -friendly economic growth. 
 14. In pursuing sustainab le development, we need to ensure balance between our 
people -centred approaches and protecting our planet. And to this end, Thailand is 
ready to work with the international community to contain the triple planetary crises 
of climate change, pollution and b iodiversity loss. Thailand is committed to 
promoting international cooperation for the protection of the environment, including 
on the negotiations on the Post -2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and the 
international legally -binding instrument on plastic p ollution.  
 
15. In tackling climate change, Thailand stands firm in our pledge at COP26 last 
year to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and net -zero greenhouse gas emissions by 
2065. And with adequate support, Thailand will be able to increase its Nation ally 
Determined Contribution or NDC target to 40 per cent while achieving net -zero 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This is not an empty promise. Thailand will 
submit our NDC and long -term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies 
(LT-LEDS) that reflect those goals ahead of the 2022 United Nations Climate 
Change Conference (COP27) at Sharm El -Sheikh.  
 
16. Meanwhile, the pledges of developed countries must also be fulfilled. I urge 
these countries to keep their promise of providing  financia l, technologica l and 
capacity -building support to developing countries and to deliver on the climate 
finance goal of 100 billion USD annually as soon as possible. Equal attention should 
be paid on mitigation and adaptation. Thailand stands ready to work wi th Egypt and 
all partners at COP27 in this regard. 
 Mr. President,  
 
Strengthening our Multilateral System and the United Nations  
 
17. We need to restore faith and confidence in the multilateral system and our United 
Nations. An important step to achieving this is to reverse the polarisation in this body 
by working more closely  on issues  that bring  us together.  Addressing humanitarian  
concerns is one such issue.  
 
18. Thailand will continue to work closely with the international community, taking 
into account the needs of the affected country, to address urgent humanitarian 
challenges through bilateral, regional and multilateral effo rts according to the key 
humanitarian principles without politicisation.  We have supported humanitarian 
work in Afghanistan through the World Food Programme (WFP) and made 
contributions for Ukraine through the Ukrainian Red Cross and UNICEF.  
 
19. As for Myanmar, Thailand has worked with partners to provide humanitarian 
assistance to the Myanmar people in need through various programmes at bilateral 
level, including donation of one million doses of COVID -19 vaccines, and through 
ASEAN. Financial contributions were also made to support the work of international 
organisations, such as UNICEF, WHO, WFP and ICRC.  
 
20. As an immediate neighbour with the longest land border, 2401 km long, it is in 
Thailand’s vital interest to see a quick return to pe ace and stability in Myanmar. We 
call on all parties in Myanmar to urgently undertake steps to de -escalate, end 
violence, and engage in meaningful talks to resolve differences peacefully. Thailand 
fully supports the constructive role of ASEAN and believes that ASEAN is best 
 placed to help Myanmar  through  the time-tested  ASEAN  practic e of Consultation, 
Cooperation and Consensus. Thailand will continue to play an active and 
constructive role to support this ASEAN process, as well as the role of the Special 
Envoy of the UNSG on Myanmar.  
 
21. As a strong believer of multilateralism, Thailand stands ready to continue to do 
its part to promote multilateral and international cooperation at all levels. Sustainable 
development and human rights are intert wined and mutually reinforcing. They are 
vital in ensuring an environment of peace and prosperity. Thailand hereby presents 
its candidacy for the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) membership for the term 
2025 -2027. If elected, we can help strengthen the Counci l and its mechanisms, to 
reach out to those vulnerable and those furthest behind, and to bring meaningful and 
real positive changes on the ground.  
 
22. Thailand  also firmly  believes  that close regional cooperation can complement 
the multilateral system and reinforce the global agenda. This year, Thailand plays 
host to Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting under the main theme 
of “Open. Conn ect. Balance.” Such theme signifies the willingness to embrace every 
opportunity, connect in all dimensions and balance in all aspects. This highlights 
Thailand’s commitment in promoting multilateral cooperation that will hopefully 
lead to a more  balanced and sustainable development after the COVID -19 pandemic. 
We look forward to welcoming world leaders to Bangkok in November, as Thailand 
is fully open and ready to welcome visitors once again. 
 Mr. President, Distinguished delegates,  
 
23. Des pite the challenges and difficulties at this critical juncture in the history of 
humanity, Thailand continues to have faith in the multilateral system with the United 
Nations at its core. And we remain confident that the goodwill and shared common 
interest s of humanity will help us make the right decisions at this watershed moment, 
so that we can move together towards a more stable, sustainable, and safer future, 
with no person or country left behind.  
 
24. Now let me add this very brief account to end my statement.  
 
25. A few days ago, a sentiment was expressed by the EU foreign policy chief when 
he said “Don’t rule out the possibilities of the use of nuclear weapons at the Ukraine 
crisis”.  
 
26. An oriental saying has it, which could be related to this context. It pertains to the 
enjoyment of riding a beast – whether it is a tiger or a dragon. Let us put a tiger in 
this context. Riding the tiger’s back could be fun and challenging, but no one could 
enjoy riding its back with no end in sight. The question is “how to dismount with 
safety, without killing the tiger”.  
 
27. Suddenly, the question of “how to” is daunting. Here we have the suggestion, 
which has taken all elements into account, and d efinitely not a “realpolitik free"". A 
possible breakthrough could be apparent through the month of November – as the 
third week of the penultimate month of the year – our first and golden opportunity 
for all super stakeholders of the Ukraine crisis to asse mble at three venues in 
Southeast Asia as legitimate participants. 
 28. The three venues – one in Phnom Penh for ASEAN Summit, another in Bali for 
G20, and the third in Bangkok, Thailand for APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting. 
They could separately or in a s eries serve as the most appropriate platforms for talks 
to provide possible off -ramp or exit to this high -tension global crisis in Ukraine.  
 
29. The World Body, UN, with all its relevant roles and mechanisms to help 
safeguard peace and stability, would certainly join in at any juncture to add value to 
this endeavour.  
 
30. So, let us hope that this golden opportunity is not passed up by all the 
superpowers, super stakeholders, with regard to the high -tension Ukraine crisis.  
 
I thank you very muc h.

Mr. President,  
We are at a historic crossroad s in the evolution of our 
multilateral system . Humanity is  facing  multiple  and 
complex  challenges , ranging from climate change, extre me 
povert y, conflicts,  terrorism, and geopolitical tension s.   
The consequences of these global challen ges are of epic 
proportions and leave adverse soc io-politic al imp acts across 
the world . Nevertheless, international cooperation is not at a 
level near th e gravity  of the  challenges.  
Although  climate  change  and the resulting  extreme  weather  
conditions  occur  throughout  the globe , the crisis  largely  
affects  the minimally  resilient  and the least responsible  for 
causing  the problem . A case in point  is our region, the Horn 
of Africa,  which  in some  parts  is hit by record -level drought  
while  sustain ing extreme  flooding  in other  parts .2 
 Mr. President   
Climate disaster  and its insufferable  impact s are 
preventable .  I, therefore , make  an urgent  call to all states  
gathered  here to translate  rhetoric  into action.    We must  
realize  our climate  finance  commitments  to build  resilience  
and mitiga te impact . We should  act to meet our emission  
reduction  targets .  This requires  focused  coordinat ion, non-
politicization,  avoidanc e of securitization , and good faith 
cooperation  among  all stakeholders.    
I must  emphasize , Africa  is not responsible  for the historic  
emissions  that caused  the climate  crisis . Yet, we are the ones 
making  the most  tangible  contribution  to mitigate  the 
impac ts of climate  change . In Ethiopia,  our afforestation  
program  – the Ethiopian  Green  Legacy  Initiative , saw the 
planting of billion s of seedlings  and created a strong  culture  
of afforestation.  We are also on a path to sustainable  energy  
transformation  and green  growth.  These proactive  program s 
deserve  recognition  and tangible  support.      
Mr. President,  
We have a  shared planet and a common  destiny. Overcoming  
our collective challenge s require  concerted  effort  and trusted 
global  leadership.  We are gathered  here because  our 
forefathers , learn ing from the tragic episod es of human  
history , decided to  establish  the U nited Nations  as the 
guardian  of peace .3 
 However , we are yet to achiev e true universality  in the main  
organs  of the United  Nations . Africa  has no permanent  seat 
at the UN Security  Council.  Our quest  for African  solutions  
to African  problems  is yet to be given  the respect  and 
support  it deserves . We believe , these consideration s 
underpin  the credibilit y of the Council  in the continent .  
African  proble ms are sustainably  addressed  when  
approached  in the true context  of the region  and take full 
account  of the strategic  interest s and aspiration s of the 
countries  concerned.   It is only when  we do these and uphold  
regional  solutions,  we could  start reducing  the proliferation  
and over extended  stay of African  issues  in the UN Security  
Council.     
Mr. President , 
For the past four years, Ethiopia has made  significant 
progress in its socio -economic development, and 
democratization .  These years have also been compounded 
by challen ges that tested our survival as a nation.   
In November 2020, the most heinous and treaso nous attack 
was waged against the Ethiopian National Defense Forces  
that protected not only the peace and stability of Ethiopia 
but also helped keep peace in other cou ntries on behalf of 
the United Nations and the African Union.4 
 The criminal group  that remai ns hell-bent in destroying  
societal  foundation  of our country  colluded with external 
actors opposed to our development aspirations . The 
insecurity  this group  create d has been very tragic  and costly . 
Yet, the Government  of Ethiopia  has earnestly tried to avoid 
this conflict . Regrettably,  our efforts  to prevent t he conflict 
from igniting were not successful.   
Thanks  to the resolve  and determination  of Ethiopians,  the 
designs  of our adversaries  against Ethiopia’s progress have 
been frustrated . We have also paved  a path for peace  and 
recovery  relying  on the ability  of the peace -loving  people  of 
Ethiopia  to reconcile , make  peace  among  ourselves  and start 
the process  of healing .   
We thus call for support to our agenda for peace, 
reconciliation , and reconstruction . We also urge  respect for 
and support to the  AU-led peace process.   Any other 
approach, including the politicization of human rights and 
unilate ral coercive measure s will not yield an y positive  
outcome.   
Mr. President,   
The past year has also been a milestone  for my country  and 
we believe  to the entire  Nile River  Basin.  Our project , the 
Grand  Ethiopian  Renaissance  Dam, commenced  lighting  our 
home s and fulfill ing our inter-generational  aspiration .5 
 All the glory and gratitude  go to the people  of Ethiopia  who 
financed  this project.  The dividend  goes far and wide to the 
entire  region.  
Taking  this opportunity , I reiterate  Ethiopia ’s commitment  to 
equity and cooperation  in the use of transboundary  rivers  
and shared  prospe rity with all riparian  countries.  We will 
continue  in good faith the trilateral  negotiation  under the 
auspices  of the African  Union  to reach  a mutually  acceptable  
outcome.    
Mr. President , 
Over the past three  years,  the implementation  of the 
Sustainable  Development  Goals encountered  serious  
setback s. The global  COVID -19 pandemic  has tested  our 
health systems .     
Global  trade  in goods  and services  was halted  causing  a 
great  deal of loss to our economies.   The response  by 
internatio nal financial  institutions  has been below  the 
required  level and did not account  for the special  
vulnera bility  of least developed  countries.    
As the Secretary  General  of the United  Nations  put it, it is 
necessary  to “turbo  charge ” the implementation  of the 
SDGs.    We call for enhanced  focus  and support  to national  
efforts  to improve  agricultural  and manufacturing  
productivity,  increase  investment,  facilitate  technology  
transfer,  foster  fair trade,  redouble  debt cancellation  and6 
 restructur ing, and enhance  international  finance  for national  
priority  projects .  Furthermore, we should enhance the 
efforts to combat illicit financial flows , unlawful extraction  
and trade  of minerals,  and corruption . 
Africa’s  youthful  popu lation  and its vast natural  resources  
should  be a source  of growth  and better  jobs. Africa  can be 
the showcase  for green  and sustainable  development.  It can 
feed and power itself and the world.    
This requires reform  of the global financial  architecture  to 
ensure more  equitable,  speedy , and collaborative  cooperation  
based on the needs and potential of least develop ed 
countries .  More importantly, we must actively support 
governments that work to create a conducive environment for 
the prosperity of their cou ntries. In addition, Africa’s effort to 
chart its destiny must not b e complicated by big power 
competition .  
Mr. President,  
Allow  me to conclude  by re-emphasizing  the need to  scale -up 
international cooperation.  The gravity  of the challenges  we 
face today dema nd us to c ome together  in search  of collective  
solutions.  We need more, not less, multilateralism. We shall 
continue to uphold our cardinal principles of independence, 
impartiality , integrity, noninterference, sovereign equality, 
and non-selectivity to maintain a working multilateral 
system rooted in the Charter of the United Nati ons.7 
 We need to reform our global institutions to reflect current 
realities. We need to make them more  representative and 
responsive to the demands of the time. Only through  genuine  
solidarity  and concerted ac tion could  we ensure  collective  
security  and prosperity.   
I thank you all for your attention and wish you, Mr. 
President , a successful term of office.

H.E. Mr. Sirojiddin Muhriddin  
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan  
 
   General Debates of the 77th Session of the  
United Nations General AssemblyDistinguished Mr. President,  
Distinguished Mr. Secretary -General,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentleman,  
 
 
Let me join previous speakers in extending our congratulations to you, Ambassador Csaba Kőrösi, 
on your election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its 77th Session.  
 
I wish to take this opportunity to pay a bef itting tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Abdulla 
Shahid, for his effective guidance and excellent leadership during the most challenging and uneasy 
times for the entire humanity.  
 
Excellencies,  
 
Our world is going through turbulent times.  
 
We are witnessing the transformation of the existing world order.  
 
Threats such as terrorism, extremism, drug and arms trafficking, cybercrime and other forms of 
cross -border organized crime have a tendency to increase exponentially.  
 
To further discuss the abovementioned issues, the Government of Tajikistan, the United Nations 
Office of Counter -Terrorism (UNOCT) and its partners will be holding a High -Level International 
Conference on ""International and Regional Border Security and Management Coo peration to 
Counter Terrorism and Prevent the Movement of Terrorists"" in Dushanbe, Tajikistan on 18 -19 
October 2022. We invite you to attend this important Conference.  
 
Climate change, natural disasters, food insecurity, ongoing impact of the pandemic, amo ng other 
things, further add fuel to the fire.  
 
The international community needs tools that are fit for today's rapidly deteriorating environment. 
Mechanisms that were established decades ago are now finding it difficult to cope with the emerging 
challeng es.  
 
The world needs more robust multilateralism to tackle the toughest challenges, with the United 
Nations at the helm.  
 
Therefore, Tajikistan supports the efforts of the U.N. Secretary -General aimed at comprehensive 
reform of the organization to streng then its capacity to timely and adequately respond to the 
development needs and efficiently address contemporary threats.  
 
There is a historic opportunity to steer change in a direction beneficial for all humanity. It shouldn't 
be wasted.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Allow me to address three additional topics which are very important for my delegation: 
implementation of our roadmap – 2030 Agenda, water, and climate change, as well as peace and 
security.Tajikistan strongly reaffirms its commitments to the full impl ementation of the 2030 Agenda and 
its Sustainable development goals.  
 
As we are lagging behind on many SDGs, the Government of Tajikistan has taken bold steps toward 
integrating SDGs into national policies and development plans. Despite substantial progres s made 
towards the achievement of SDGs, there are significant risks, such as climate -related hazards and 
disasters that could slow or reverse Tajikistan's path towards the realization of 2030 Agenda and 
threaten agricultural productivity and food security.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
This year the world has witnessed unprecedented water -related natural disasters.  
 
While we all have been struggling with the consequences of these water -related disasters, we are 
becoming increasingly aware that water is vital and a resource we must value, protect, and manage 
effectively.  
 
We need actions that can make a real differenc e.  
 
On 6 -9 June 2022, we successfully held the Second Dushanbe Conference in Tajikistan, which 
became a key preparatory meeting for the midterm review of the Water Decade in 2023.  
 
As you are aware, on 22 -24 March 2023, the U.N. will convene its second water conference after 46 
years.  
 
The U.N. 2023 Water Conference will be a good opportunity for all of us to review and evaluate the 
progress made and the gaps and obstacles we have encountered in realizing the goals of the Water 
Decade.  
 
Tajikistan and the Net herlands, leading the preparations for this global event, are diligently working 
and are determined to make the Conference a watershed moment for the whole world.  
 
To this end, we launched the Water Action Agenda as one of the outcomes of the UN 2023 Water  
Conference. We expect and encourage everyone to come to the Conference with new commitments 
to enrich the Water Action Agenda.  
 
This is important and necessary not only for us today, but for our children, our future generation!  
 
Mr. President,  
 
The impact  of climate change on water resources is another crucial topic that requires our concerted 
efforts. Alongside the increase in mudflows and floods, water scarcities and droughts, and changes 
in the hydrological cycle, today, the accelerated melting of glaci ers, the primary sources of fresh 
water on the planet, is of great concern.  
 
 
To this end, Tajikistan is actively promoting an integrated approach to addressing water and climate 
issues, including within Water and Climate Coalition. During the Coalition's first meeting, H.E. 
Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic of Tajikistan, proposed declaring 2025 as an 
international year of Glaciers' Preservation. We are currently working on the draft resolution to 
advance the said initiative through the second comm ittee of the U.N. General Assembly. We seek 
your constructive engagement and support for this important resolution.Mr. President,  
 
Response to the ever -increasing threat of terrorism and extremism should be comprehensive, with 
the U.N. as a key coordina tor.  
 
For its part, Tajikistan has undertaken several measures in this direction. We have, among other 
things, adopted our ""National Strategy and Action Plan of the Republic of Tajikistan on Countering 
Terrorism and Extremism for 2021 -2025"" and expressed our readiness.  
 
Tajikistan strongly believes that small states should also have a greater chance to contribute to 
finding solutions for maintaining peace and security.  
 
Hence, following years of contributions to multilateralism through active participation in the United 
Nations activities and processes and having unique peacemaking experience and insightful 
knowledge about Afghanistan, the time has come for Tajikistan to seek for the first time, its non -
permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council for 2028 -2029.  
 
We are looking forward to closely working with all the U.N. member states to gain the trust and 
support for this vital campaign.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Tajikistan, a pe ace-loving country that went through a devastating imposed Civil War, is very aware 
of its cost and long -lasting consequences.  
 
Therefore, we can't stay indifferent to the fate of our immediate neighbors – the noble people of 
Afghanistan, who have suffered  enough for the past 40 years. They deserve peace and tranquility.   
 
Exactly one year ago, in this very same room, the President of Tajikistan, H.E. Mr. Emomali 
Rahmon, in his virtual message before the United Nations General Assembly, dedicated more than  
half of his statement to the situation in Afghanistan.  
 
His concerns and warnings, unfortunately, fell on deaf ears.  
 
One year after the fall of Afghanistan:  
 
- No inclusive government has been formed despite repeated calls from Afghans, regional 
countri es and the international community for greater ethnic, political and geographical diversity in 
the de facto administrative structures.  
 
- The country is on the verge of humanitarian and economic catastrophe. To ease the suffering 
of the Afghan people duri ng these difficult times, Tajikistan has provided its infrastructure, territory, 
and communication means to all stakeholders and donor countries to deliver humanitarian assistance 
directly to the people of Afghanistan. We have also never stopped providing the people of 
Afghanistan with much -needed electricity since the Taliban came to power;  
 
- The environment of intimidation and a deterioration in respect for human rights, including 
the rights of women and girls, is overwhelming.  
 
- Diverging opinions and  existing internal contradictions within the Taliban and the emergence 
of additional armed opposition groups, including ISIL -K and other terrorist groups, make the 
security situation in the country even more fragile. Furthermore, Taliban’s inability to con trol its 
militants and other terrorist groups further complicates the already difficult situation. The recentdiscovery and killing of one of Al -Qaeda's top strategic minds in Kabul is a vivid testimony of those 
ties; 
 
- Afghanistan is rapidly becoming a s afe haven for terrorist groups and a springboard for 
spreading the Taliban's radical extremism. In addition, we are witnessing systematic work on 
transferring militant groups consisting of former nationals of Central Asia to the north of 
Afghanistan aimed at consolidating and creating a new hotbed of tensions near our borders.  
 
Unfortunately, the implications for Tajikistan, which shares 1400 km of border with this country, 
are enormous.  
 
In the current alarming situation, it is paramount for Tajikistan to strengthen its border with 
Afghanistan and create the necessary border infrastructure along its entire length.  
 
At the same time, we believe that the participation of Afghanistan in the process of multifaceted 
regional cooperation is a key to the success of the efforts undertaken by the international community.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
On 20th September 2022, the leadership of the Kyrgyz Republic,  delivered his speech from this 
high rostrum, ta lked about Kyrgyz version of the conflict on the Tajik -Kyrgyz border.  
 
Its regrettable  that the issues of settlement of the state border line between Tajikistan and 
Kyrgyzstan, which we inherited from history, are groundlessly raised at the UN General Ass embly.  
 
I believe it is important to inform you that on September 19th, 2022, the authorized representatives 
of the two sides signed the Protocol on the settlement of the situation at the border. All hostilities 
have ceased.  
 
The troops and military equip ment of both sides must be withdrawn to their places of permanent 
deployment. A joint inspection was organized in the border area. A joint task force has been set up 
to monitor the implementation of the agreements reached. Most importantly, both parties re affirmed 
their commitment to resolving all bilateral issues exclusively by political and diplomatic means. 
Tajikistan has followed and will always follow this principle when any issues arise, including the 
settlement of the situation on the border.  
 
It is with deep regret that Kyrgyzstan is deviating from the agreements reached, creating a false 
appearance of withdrawing troops and heavy military equipment from the line of contact by hiding 
them in populated areas near the border. Therefore, the responsibil ity for any next round of tension 
on the Tajik -Kyrgyz border will lie exclusively with Kyrgyzstan.  
 
The leadership of the neighboring country, in their speech, mentioned the death of their citizens and 
financial damage, creating the false impression that t he tragedy on the border affected them 
exclusively. The evidences say otherwise. As a result of military aggression of Kyrgyzstan, more 
than forty civilians of Tajikistan were killed and about two hundred were injured. The casualties 
include pregnant women , children, elderlies, doctors, as well as devout Muslims - attendants of the 
mourning ceremony in the mosque.  
 
In addition to border facilities, schools, hospitals, religious buildings, residential buildings, 
infrastructure and utilities were destroyed. S o, who is the aggressor here?  
 
Tajikistan is currently channeling significant resources to rebuilding destroyed houses and vital 
infrastructure.The tragedy that happened in the border area is not accidental. Since the last autumn our neighbors 
have been preparing for aggression, which manifested itself in the creation of military infrastructure 
near our borders.  
 
In recent years, our neighbors have often spoken, including from this high rostrum, about the 
importance of an international transport artery an d the creation of favorable conditions for 
transportation, while advocating “the removal of barriers to economic cooperation, the simplification 
of procedures for passing borders and transit between countries and regions."" At the same time, 
Kyrgyzstan ofte n creates problems for the transit of goods to / from Tajikistan, delaying vehicles 
with thousands of tons of our cargo.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
It’s important to note that we managed to successfully resolve the border issue with China and 
Uzbekistan, and this is an achievement of a lengthy process for all parties.  
 
We have accumulated enough experience, which is important to use in its entirety when resolving 
border issues on the basis of mutual respect, trust and openness.  
 
Over the twenty -year history of negotiations with Kyrgyzstan, we have signed dozens of protocols. 
However, as time passes with the change of political groups in power, they continuously revisit these 
documents and implement only those provisions that are i n favor of them exclusively, while ignoring 
the other provisions.  
 
As of today, both countries managed to agree on and develop a draft description of about six hundred 
and two kilometers of our joint border, which is approximately sixty -one percent of its  total length.  
 
Tajikistan, relying on the international practice of border delimitation, has repeatedly offered its 
neighbors to record the results of this many years of work on paper, by signing an agreement on 
separate sections of the border. But our ne ighbors strictly decline this proposal.  
 
The leadership of Kyrgyzstan mentioned in this high rostrum the Agreement on the Establishment 
of the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Alma -Ata Declaration, presenting them as a 
legal framework for determi ning the state border.  
 
However, I have to emphasize that the issue of determining the border line is not the subject of 
regulation of these documents. To our deep regret, relying on its unilateral approach, since 1950s, 
Kyrgyzstan has arbitrarily seized more than two thousand one hundred and ten (2110) square 
kilometers that rightfully belong to Tajikistan. Our neighbors didn't mention anything about it either.  
 
I would like to inform the General Assembly that Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan have reached an 
agreement on the description of the state border line according to the documents of the national -
territorial delimitation of 1924 -1927.  
 
It is these documents that have gone through all the constitutional procedures and, accordingly, are 
the only legal frame work for continuing the negotiation process. Despite this, in order to show 
goodwill and maximum flexibility, we met our neighbor halfway and agreed to also use the 
documents of the 1989 parity commission proposed by Kyrgyzstan.  
 
Border issues are not reso lved by the populist statements and the creation of crisis situations. We 
need daily, thoughtful, joint work based on the political will of the parties.We stand ready to continue negotiations and firmly believe that the Tajik and Kyrgyz peoples have 
the right to live and build together an atmosphere of peace, friendship and harmony.  
 
Tajikistan, having survived the horrors of internal conflict, understands the value of peace, and will 
make all its efforts to ensure that security and stability reign in ou r region.  
 
I thank you for your attention!", TJK,2022

 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY  
 
ADDRESS BY DR. S JAISHANKAR, EXTERNAL AFFAIRS 
MINISTER OF INDIA AT THE GENERAL DEBATE OF THE 77TH 
SESSION OF THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
Sat, 24 Sep 2022  
Mr. President,  
 
Excellencies,  
 
Distinguished Members of the General Assembly,  
 
I bring to you the greetings of 1. 3 billion  plus people from the 
world’s largest democracy . They join me in congratulat ing you, 
Mr. President,  on your election to chair the 77th Session of the 
UN General Assembly. They follow closely developments at the 
UN, reflecting the increasingly globalized nature of our 
existence.  
 
We meet at a challenging time for the world  order . This session’s 
theme  - “A Watershed Moment: Transformative Solutions to 
Interlocking Challenges”  – seeks to capture its seriousness .As on September 24, 2022; 0800 Hrs  
2 
 Excellencies,  
 
The year 2022 is an important milestone in India’s journey 
towards growth, development and prosperity.   
 
India is celebrating 75 years of its independence , what we call 
“Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav ”. The story of th at period  has been 
one of toil, determination, innovation  and enterprise of millions 
of ordinary Indians. They are rejuvenating a society pillaged by 
centuries of foreign attacks and colonialism.  
 
And they are doing so in a democratic framework, whose stead y 
progress is reflected in more authentic voices and grounded 
leadership .  
 
This ‘New India ’, under the visionary and dynamic leadership of 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is a confident  and resurgent 
society.  Its agenda for our centenary will be achieved through 
the five pledges that we committed to on Independence Day.    
 
One, we are resolved to make India a developed country in the 
next 25 years. For the world, that creates  more capacities for 
global good.As on September 24, 2022; 0800 Hrs  
3 
  
Two, we will liberate ourselves from a colonial mindset. 
Exter nally, this means reformed multilateralism and more 
contemporary global governance .  
 
Three, our rich civilizational heritage will be a source of pride 
and strength. This include s care and concern for the 
environment , so ingrained in our traditional ethos . 
 
Four, we will promote greater unity and solidarity. This 
expresse s a coming together on global issues, such as terrorism, 
pandemics or  the environment . 
 
And five, instilling consciousness of duties and responsibilities. 
This applies to nations , as much as it does to citizens.  
 
These five pledges  affirm  our ag e-old outlook  that sees the world 
as one family . We believe that national good and global good can 
be entirely in harmony.  
 
It is this  conviction that led us to supply vaccines to over 100 
nations.  Similarly, our evacuation operations in HADRAs on September 24, 2022; 0800 Hrs  
4 
 (Humanitarian Assistance  and Disaster Relief ) situations always 
have had room  for other nationals in distress.  
 
Even as we meet our own development targets, India offers 
partnerships to our brothers and sisters in  Asia, Africa and Latin 
America . And we do so based on their needs and priorities.  
 
Today, that focus is on green growth, better connectivity, digital 
delivery and accessible health.  Our solidarity is not just words; 
you can see them in 700 projects across the world.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Even w hile India  contribute s to global betterment , we recognize 
the sharp deterioration in the international landscape. The world 
is already struggling with challenges of post pandemic  economic  
recovery. The debt situation of the developing is precarious.  
 
To this , is now added the rising costs and shrinking availability  
of fuel, food and fertilizer s. These, along with trade disruptions 
and diversions, are among the many consequences of the 
Ukraine conflict.As on September 24, 2022; 0800 Hrs  
5 
 The Indo -Pacific too witnesses fresh concerns about its stability 
and security.  And climate events have added an overlay on these 
mounting anxietie s.   
 
As we saw in the case of the Covid pandemic , the South will be 
most impacted, even if the immediate causes are well beyond. It 
is imperative that global conversations recognize this 
unfairness.  The inequity of vaccine distribution should not be 
replicated in other domains.  
  
Mr. President,  
 
As the Ukraine conflict continue s to rage, we are often asked 
whose  side we are on.  
 
And our answer , each time , is straight and honest.  
 
India is on the side of peace and will remain firmly there.   
 
We are on the side that respects the UN Charter and its founding 
principles.  
 
We are on the side that calls for dialogue and diplomacy as the 
only way out.As on September 24, 2022; 0800 Hrs  
6 
 We are on the side of those struggling to make ends meet , even 
as they stare at  escalating costs of food, fuel and fertilizers.  
 
It is therefore in our collective interest to work constructively, 
both within the United Nations and outside, in finding  an early 
resolution to this conflict . 
 
Excellencies , 
 
While the global attention has been on Ukraine, India has also 
had to contend with other challenges , especially  in its own 
neighbourhood .   
 
Some of them may be aggravated by the Covid pandemic and 
ongoing conflicts ; but they speak too of a deeper malaise. The 
accumulation of debt in fragile economies is of particular 
concern.  
 
We believe that in such times, the international community 
must  rise above narrow national agendas. India, for its part, is 
taking exceptional measures in exceptional times.As on September 24, 2022; 0800 Hrs  
7 
 We do so, w hen we s ent 50,000 metric ton s of wheat and multiple 
tranches of medicines and vaccines to Afghanistan .   
 
When we  extend credits of 3.8 billion dollars to Sri Lanka for 
fuel, essential commodities and trade settlement .  
 
When we suppl ied 10,000 metric ton s of food aid and vaccine 
shipments to Myanmar . 
 
When we fill the gap in humanitarian needs left unaddressed by 
political complexity . 
 
Whether it is disaster response or humanitarian assistance, India 
has stood  strong , contribut ing particularly to those nearest to 
us.   
 
Excellencies,  
 
The world , as we knew it , is poised for transformational changes.  
 
It has been impacted in recent times by a succession of shocks, 
each of them significant by itself.As on September 24, 2022; 0800 Hrs  
8 
 The Covid pandemic called into question the over -centralized 
nature of globalization and has led all of us to seek greater  
resilience and reliability of supply chains .  
 
The repercussions of the ongoing Ukraine conflict have further 
heightened economic stresses , especially on food and energy.  
 
Climate events have added to the disruption that the world is 
already facing.  
 
As for the promise of technology, it has certainly multiplied our 
capabilities  but also added to vulnerabilities.  
 
Trust and transparency are legitimate expectations of a more 
digitized world.  
 
The quest to create a better global order would necessarily have 
to address all these issues. Among them, some are clearly more 
existential in nature and necessitate intense co ordination by the 
international community.  
 
Climate action and climate justice are particularly noteworthy 
in this respect. In their pursuit, India has worked with partners 
on the International Solar Alliance, the One Sun -One World -One 
Grid initiative and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient 
Infrastructure.As on September 24, 2022; 0800 Hrs

We stand ready to support any collective and equitable endeavor 
to protect  our environment and to further global wellness . 
“Lifestyle for Environment ” or LiFE, as declared  by Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi in Glasgow on the sidelines of COP26 is 
our homage  to Mother Nature.   
 
India remains  deeply committed to fighting climate change 
under the UNFCCC ( United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change ) and the Paris Agreement. We do so on the 
principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and 
respective capabilities, in the light of different national 
circumstances.  We have announced our updated Nationally 
Determined Contributions after COP26.  
 
Excellencies,  
 
India’s steadfast commitment to South -South Cooperation is 
well established . Our approach is based on principles of mutual 
respect and national ownership with a commitment to 
sustainable development for all.  
 
As we begin the G -20 presidency this December , we are sensitive 
to the  challenges faced by developing countries. India will workAs on September 24, 2022; 0800 Hrs  
10 
 with other G -20 members to address serious issues of debt, 
economic growth, food and energy security and particularly, 
environm ent. The reform of governance of multilateral financial 
institutions will continue to be one of our core priorities.  
 
Excellencies,  
 
India would be completing its tenure as a member of the Security 
Council this year . In our term, we have acted as a bridge on some 
serious but divisive issues confronting the Council. We have also 
focused on concerns  such as maritime security, peace keeping 
and counter terrorism. Our contributions range from providing 
technology with a human touch  to ensuring the safety and 
security of UN Peacekeepers.  
 
As the Chair of the Counter Terrorism Committee  this year , 
India would be hosting  its special meeting  in Mumbai and New 
Delhi . I invite all member states to participate in it. We need to  
create  a global architecture that responds  to the new tech tools 
deploy ed against open , diverse  and pluralistic societies .As on September 24, 2022; 0800 Hrs  
11 
 Having born e the brunt of  cross border terrorism for  decades , 
India firmly advocate s a ‘zero -tolerance’ approach . In our view, 
there is no  justification for any act of terrorism, regardless of  
motivation.  And no rhetoric, however sanctimonious can ever 
hide blood -stained  hands.  
 
The United Nations respon ds to terrorism by sanctioning its 
perpetrators. Th ose who  politicize the UNSC  1267 Sanctions 
regime , sometimes to the extent of defending proclaimed  
terrorists , do so at their own peril. Believe me, they advance 
neither their  own interests nor indeed their reputation.  
 
India has always espoused a cooperative, inclusive, and 
consultative approach to international relations.  
 
We believe that multipolarity,  rebalancing , fair globalization and 
reformed multilateralism  cannot be kept in abeyance .  
 
The call  for reformed multilateralism – with reforms of the 
Security Council at its core – enjoys considerable support among 
UN members.  
 
It does so because of the widespread recognition that the current 
architecture is anachronistic and ineffective. It is also perceivedAs on September 24, 2022; 0800 Hrs  
12 
 as deeply unfair, denying entire continents and regions a voice 
in a forum that deliberates their future .  
 
India is prepa red to take up greater responsibilities. But it seeks 
at the same time to ensure that the injustice faced by the Global 
South is decisively addressed.  
 
Our call is to allow serious negotiations on such a critical matter 
to proceed sincerely . They must not be  blocked by procedural 
tactics.   Naysayers cannot hold the IGN process hostage in 
perpetuity.    
 
In these turbulent times, it is essential that the world listens to  
more voices of reason . And experience s more acts of goodwill.  
India is willing and ab le on both  counts.  
 
We believe and advocate that this is not an era of war and 
conflict . On the contrary, it is a time for development and 
cooperation.  
 
Mr. President,As on September 24, 2022; 0800 Hrs  
13 
 In the past, t his august assembly has served as a meeting point 
of views and a catalyst for action.  
 
It is vital that we continue to believe in the promise of diplomacy 
and the need for international cooperation.  
 
Therefore, Mr. President, let us strive  to return to the course of 
seeking peace, progress and prosperity .

 SWE_77_2022,"Sweden's National Statement at the 
General Debate of the 77th Session 
of the General Assembly of the 
United Nations  
24 SEP 2022  
Address by Foreign Minister of Sweden Ann Linde at the General 
Debate of the 77th Session of the General Assembly of the United 
Nations, 24 September 2022, New York  
Mr President, Excellencies,  
Times of crisis require the best of us. When warnings sound, action 
must follow. Only then will development be sustainable, and peace 
maintained.  
Honest reflection on the gravity of th e challenges must be followed by 
determined commitments to address them. That is what respecting 
the UN Charter means and what multilateralism is all about. 
Mr President,    
We are all aware of the immense tasks facing us.  
Almost 350 million people in more than 80 countries face acute food 
insecurity, trying to merely survive the day instead of making plans for 
tomorrow. Some 50 million people in 45 countries are on the brink of 
starvation.  
Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals is halting, leaving 
millions of women, men and children behind. Extreme poverty is on 
the rise for the first time in two decades. The world is in the midst of 
an accelerating climate and environmental crisis, and the effects ofthe ongoing pandemic continue to afflict individua ls and societies 
around the world.  
A permanent member of the Security Council has launched an 
unprovoked, unjustified and illegal aggression against a neighbouring 
country. This was done in blatant disregard of its international 
obligations and the human s uffering that extends far beyond the 
immediate war zone.  
Mr President,  
As UN Member States, we also know what is required of us.  
The General Assembly has come together to demand that Russia 
“immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its 
military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally 
recognised borders”. The General Assembly has reaffirmed Ukrainian 
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.  
Today, Sweden reiterates this demand in the strongest possible t erms, 
alongside other EU Member States, transatlantic partners, and 
countries around the globe.  
The war in Ukraine must stop, and Russia’s troops withdraw. The fake 
“referenda” on Ukrainian territory would be illegal and will have no 
effect. Neither partia l mobilisation, nuclear sabre rattling, nor any 
other escalation will deter us from supporting Ukraine. Humanitarian 
law and principles must be upheld, and Ukraine’s nuclear power plants 
protected from Russia’s illegal and reckless attacks. Accountability for 
the heinous crimes committed must be ensured. International law 
must be upheld and decisions by UN bodies respected.  
Mr President,  
Russia’s aggression has severely escalated the food security, energy 
and financial crises.Governments and societies already struggling to cope with the 
consequences of climate change, conflicts and the pandemic now 
face even more serious challenges. Because of the actions of one 
country, more than one and a half billion people in more than half of 
the UN Members States find  themselves at greater risk of poverty, 
starvation and indebtedness.  
In short, the global relief, recovery and resilience needs are immense. 
Sweden and the EU have scaled up our own contributions to meet 
them.  
To save lives and alleviate suffering where needs are the greatest, 
Sweden has increased its humanitarian assistance to a record high 
USD  950  million this year. We commend the efforts of the UN 
Secretary General and the President of Türkiye on the Black Sea Grain 
Initiative. Under the Initiative, some  fifty thousand tonnes of wheat 
will, thanks partly to Swedish funding, soon leave the port of Odesa, 
bound for millions of women, men and children at risk of famine in 
Yemen.  
A significant part of Sweden’s ambitious aid budget has been directed 
to the UN, as an investment in global peace, security and development, 
and the multilateral system itself.  
Our actions are firmly anchored in the 2030 Agenda with the SDGs and 
in the Paris Agreement, which are now more important than ever.  
It is time to raise our ambition and accelerate action to tackle climate 
change and biodiversity loss, or we’ll fail not only future generations, 
but also our own.  
At the international meeting Stockholm+50 in June this year, countries 
came together to follow through on recommend ations and actions. 
Sweden has spearheaded the climate transition through innovation 
and green investments, and an ambitious increase in climate aid.Mounting evidence shows that climate change also leads to greater 
risks to peace and stability. A solid fo undation for advancing climate 
security is in place, at the UN and in regional organisations. The OSCE 
took key decisions last year during the Swedish Chairpersonship, and 
the EU is scaling up.  
The nuclear threat is alarmingly present, and Russia’s actions  lower 
the threshold in a way that increases the threat facing us all.  
In January this year, the leaders of all five Nuclear Weapons States 
committed to the prevention of nuclear war and avoiding arms race. 
They affirmed that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be 
fought. Russia’s irresponsible actions and nuclear rhetoric since then 
severely undermines the credibility of its commitment to this pledge. It 
is also deeply troubling that Russia broke consensus on the draft 
outcome document of the NPT Review Conference.  
The countries of the Stockholm Initiative have presented ideas to heed 
the call from the UN Secretary -General to bring disarmament and non-
proliferation back to the top of the international agenda.  
Mr President,  
The world is in a gender eq uality recession.  
Regrettably, the rights, resources and representation of women still 
cannot be taken for granted. Violence against women and girls has 
increased. Access to safe and legal abortion has suffered major 
setbacks. And one year after the Taliba n takeover, the situation for 
women and girls in Afghanistan has turned into a nightmare, in an 
unparalleled system of discrimination.  
At the same time, more and more states are acknowledging that a 
gender perspective is needed to meet global challenges.As we gather for the first in -person UNGA high level week since the 
outbreak of COVID -19, we must do everything in our power to prevent 
another pandemic.  
Sweden and the EU have made substantial contributions to global 
vaccination. Last year alone, Sweden co mmitted over USD  600  million 
to global health. The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness 
and Response has set out clear recommendations for action. We 
should make use of them.  
Mr President,  
A year ago, the UN Secretary -General presented his blueprint  for a 
modern multilateral system. Our Common Agenda is an accelerator of 
the SDGs, a launch pad for a New Agenda for Peace and a way 
towards a more inclusive, modern, and networked UN.  
It was us Member States who called for the report – and as Member 
States we should do our collective best to act upon it.  
The establishment of a new youth office is a fitting first decision – 
this is an agenda for the future. And the Transforming Education 
Summit earlier this week was another important step towards 
implement ation.  
We look forward to similar progress on other recommendations, from 
investments in peace -building and strategic foresight, to digitalisation 
and a global economy that benefits all by being fair and open. We 
must keep up the momentum until we realise our ambitions, at the 
Summit of the Future in 2024.  
Mr President,  
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has caused the greatest refugee 
crisis in Europe since the Second World War, aggravating the already 
serious refugee situation globally.This military inv asion of a country in our neighbourhood – in violation 
of the very same international law that is to protect us all from 
aggression – has also fundamentally changed Sweden’s security 
environment.  
In response to this seriously deteriorated security situation, the 
Swedish Government decided on 16 May to apply for NATO 
membership. The decision has broad national support and was made 
following extensive consultations among political parties. It was taken 
in tandem with Finland. And the decision is anchored in a firm belief 
that security is best built together with others.  
When I signed our formal request for NATO membership, I noted the 
fundamental changes to our defence and security policy. But I also 
stressed the importance of the continuity of our ambitious g lobal and 
multilateral foreign policy.  
This enduring global commitment is also reflected in the Common 
Foreign and Security Policy of the EU. During the first half of 2023, 
Sweden will hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. 
We look forwa rd to further strengthening the EU’s global role, and 
deepening cooperation with partners around the world. We will work 
to protect, promote and defend democratic principles, human rights 
and the rule of law. And we will reinforce the already solid EU -UN 
relationship to seek multilateral solutions.  
We lend our full support to Denmark’s candidacy to serve as an 
elected member on the UN Security Council 2025 to 2026. Their 
campaign message – equality, security, action – is a message from all 
the Nordic countries.  
Mr President,  
It must be safe to work for peace, security, development and human 
rights.So far this year, there have been 176 attacks against humanitarian 
workers and 47 have been killed. More than 50 peacekeepers have 
lost their lives while serving on UN missions.  
A few months ago, the UN Secretary -General and I inaugurated a work 
of art – in this very building – in memory of Zaida Catalán and Michael 
Sharp, who were murdered while working for the UN in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo.  
In too many countries, civil society representatives, human rights 
defenders and journalists are threatened, subjected to violence or 
even killed for expressing their opinions or for reporting on current 
events.  
The global trend of democratic backsliding mu st be reversed, and the 
vicious circle of lack of democracy, disrespect for human rights and 
disregard of the rule of law broken. Investing in democracy, means 
investing in peace and sustainable development.  
Efforts must continue to bring clarity to the ci rcumstances of the 
death of former Secretary General of the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld, and 
his crew. We fully support the work of the UN appointed independent 
investigator.  
Mr President,  
To echo the topic of this debate, we are at a watershed moment.  
We are wit nessing a full- scale war in Europe. Across the globe, armed 
conflict and repression cause suffering and halts development. We 
are not doing enough to tackle the climate crisis. Too many people are 
facing hunger, being forced to flee their homes, dying from  curable 
diseases and living in fear or under oppression.  
We, the United Nations, must make sure there is a different story to 
tell next year.It won’t be easy. But it is possible – if we heed the call to meet 
interlocking challenges with transformative ch ange. If we act when 
warnings sound.  
Thank you.

  1 STATEMENT  
by 
 H.E. Mr. Nikolay  Milkov,  Minister  of Foreign  Affairs  of the Republic  of 
Bulgaria  
77th Session  of the United  Nations  General  Assembly  
General  Debate,  24 September  2022  
 
 
MR. PRESIDENT  OF THE GENERAL  ASSEMBLY,   
MR. SECRETARY -GENERAL,  
EXCELLENCIES,   
LADIES  AND  GENTLEMEN,   
 
We are living  in unprecedented  times  of many  challenges  - war and 
insecurity,  energy  and food crisis,  climate  change,  still existing  
consequences  in the wake of the Covid  - 19 pandemic.  And this list of 
challenges  is far from being  complete.  The abruptly  increased  security  risks 
and the tectonic  instabilities  that occurred  since  the last UNGA  session  are 
threatening  to destroy  the ruled  based  world  order.  An order  that has been  
built here,  in this hall by all of you, by sovereign  states  and by the peoples  of 
this world.  For this reason  at the present  UNGA  Session  the majority  of the 
speakers  by far perceive  as the biggest  security  risk the war that the Russi an 
Federation  wages  against  its neighbor,  breaking  basic  international  rules  and 
the UN Charter  itself.  This illegal  military  aggression  carried  out by 
permanent  member  of the Security  Council,  not only undermines  global  
security,  but also puts the interna tional  rules -based  order  in jeopardy.  
Bulgaria  is deeply  concerned  with the recent  escalation  of the conflict  andCheck  against  delivery!  
  2 the partial  mobilization  announced  by the Russian  Federation.  We reject  the 
ongoing  sham  referenda  in occupied  Ukraine  and consider  them  neith er free, 
nor fair and without  any binding  force.  
 
In these  unfortunate  circumstances  each  and every  contribution  for 
achieving  more  stability  and cooperation  among  states  in different  regions  
must  be encouraged  and welcomed.  
 
As South -East European  country , Bulgaria  attaches  utmost  importance  to 
the peace,  stability  and prosperity  in the region  of the Western  Balkans.  We 
are confident  that the transformative  power  of the EU integration  process  
and the inclusive  regional  cooperation  are both the most  powerfu l tools  for 
achieving  a common  space  of democratic  governance,  market  economy  and 
political,  economic  and social  sustainability.  We will continue  to support  
these  countries  on the path to the EU. 
 
Bulgaria  is concerned  of the lack of progress  in the effort s to advance  the 
Middle  East Peace  Process,  as well as the recent  escalation  of tension  in 
the Gaza  Strip.  An enhanced  cooperation  between  international  and regional  
partners  is needed  for providing  political  horizon  for the resumption  of 
bilateral  Israeli -Palestinian  negotiations.  A negotiated  and viable  two-state  
solution  that allows  both Palestinians  and Israelis  to live side-by-side in 
peace,  within  secure  and recognized  borders  is essential  for stability  of the 
entire  Middle  East.  
 
Bulgaria  is followin g with concern  the critical  developments  in Afghanistan,  
including  the human  rights  situation,  and the restrictions  imposed  by theCheck  against  delivery!  
  3 Taliban  on the rights  of women,  on girls' access  to education  and on 
journalists.   
 
LADIES  AND  GENTLEMEN,   
 
The war in Europe  has global  repercussions.  The Russian  aggression  
against  Ukraine  has caused  food insecurity  and energy  crisis  that have  
devastating  socio -economic  impacts  on the countries  worldwide.   
 
The global  food system  has already  been  under  pressure  even  before,  due 
to factors  as climate  change,  and COVID -19 pandemic.  However,  the crisis  
escalated  dramatically  because  of the war, as disruptions  in food,  energy  
and financial  systems  in over 90 countries  around  the world  have  put 1.7 
billion  people  at risk.   
 
Bulgaria  highly  appreciates  the UN-Türkiye  mediated  deal on the resumption  
of grain  exports  from Ukraine's  Black  Sea ports,  and fully shares  the 
assessment  that this very welcome  development  has the potential  to 
alleviate  significantly  the current  food crisis. Notwithstanding,  the situation  
still remains  critical,  and the need  for humanitarian  assistance  to a number  
of countries  in the Global  South  persists.  
   
EXCELLENCIES,   
LADIES  AND  GENTLEMEN,   
 
Some  two and a half years  ago, we were  faced  with the first lethal  pandemic  
of the 21st century,  which  changed  our lifestyles,  the way of doing  business,Check  against  delivery!  
  4 and, above  all, the way we communicate  with each  other.  The COVID -19 
pandemic  also triggered  a revolution  in human  online  activities  and inter-
action  through  different  digital  communication  platforms.  It also caused  huge  
quakes  in both societies  and economies;  deepened  the gap between  the rich 
and poor,  applying  to both people  as well as to entire  nations,  wiped  out at 
least  a decade  of progress  made  in reaching  the Agenda  2030  Sustainable  
Development  Goals.  
   
Our planet is visibly  suffering  from the devastating  effects  of climate  change:  
deforestation,  desertification,  weather  extremes,  environment  degradation,  
loss of biodiversity,  affecting  in one way or another  each  and every  one of 
us, no matter  where  we live.  
Action is urgently  needed!   
 
EXCELLENCIES,   
LADIES  AND  GENTLEMEN,   
 
We are deeply  concerned  about  the humanitarian  and food crises  in Africa,  
especially  in the Sahel  and Lake  Chad  regions,  further  exacerbated  by the 
Russian  invasion  of Ukraine.  They  come  as an additional  burden  on post-
COVID  recovery  efforts.  In this context,  specific  and comprehensive  
responses  are needed,  addressing  short -term needs  of the countries  
concerned,  as well as strengthening  their resilience  and sustainability.  
Therefore,  we comme nd the efforts  of both the UN and the African  Union  to 
address  those  challenges.Check  against  delivery!  
  5 Dialogue  and cooperation  with the countries  from the Indo-Pacific  Region  is 
becoming   particularly  important.  Bulgaria  supports  the strengthening  of 
partnerships  with like-minded  countries  from the region  in energy  
connectivity,  digitalization,  people -to-people  contacts,  security  of supplies,  
security  and defense,  countering  disinformation,  etc. As the country  holding  
the Presidency  of ECOSOC,  we attach  great  importance  to the priorities  of 
emerging  economies  with regard  to sustainable  development,  as well as to 
the priorities  of the small  island  States,  taking  into account  their specific  
needs,  including  their existential  struggle  with the impact  of global  warming,  
the consta nt rise of Sea level.   
 
I would  like now to share  with you on another  very important  and pressing  
issue.  The world  finds  itself at a watershed  moment  for human  rights  as it 
faces  numerous  challenges  in this regard.  Neither  peace,  nor prosperity,  can 
be meaningful  concepts  without  the full respect  for human  rights  and human  
dignity.  We are a staunch  supporter  of the universality  and indivisibility  of 
human  rights,  democracy  and the rule of law. Being  an active  member  of the 
Human  Rights  Council  in 2019 -2021,  Bulgaria  firmly  promoted  the rights  of 
the child,  of women  and girls,  as well as their empowerment.  Gender  equality  
and the protection  of the rights  of persons  with disabilities  are also key 
priorities  for my country.  Strongly  committed  to further  advanci ng the human  
rights  agenda  worldwide,  Bulgaria  has presented  its candidature  for HRC  
membership  during  the period  2024 -2026.   
 
Education  is a basic  human  right with a transformative  power  to foster  a fairer  
and more  inclusive  world.  Education  is a solid foundation  for future  peace,  
tolerance  and sustainable  development.  Over  the last couple  of years,  theCheck  against  delivery!  
  6 COVID -19 pandemic  further  limited  the access  of children  to education  in the 
developing  world.  This motivated  my country  to play an active  role in the 
preparation  of the Transforming  Education  Summit  and we are encouraged  
by the successful  outcome  of the Summit.   
 
Let me now briefly  turn to the UN reform  in the three  closely  interrelated  
areas:  governance,  peace  and security,  and sustainable  development.  We 
cannot  be complacent  with the pace  of reform  so far and we must  seize  the 
historic  wave  of opportunity  to make  strides  in the process.  Therefore  
Bulgaria  supports  acceleration  of the reform  efforts  in line with the proposals  
in the Report  of the Secretary -General  ""Our Common  Agenda"",  aimed  at 
reaching  a new global  consensus  on our future  and stepping  up the 
multilateral  cooperation  to achieve  it.  
 
We support  the comprehensive  reform  of the Security  Council.  We have  
come  to a critical  juncture  where  further  keeping  the status  quo is untenable.  
The present  situation  when  this highest  UN body  fails to play its key role 
under  the Charter  cannot  be tolerated  by the international  community  and 
this is a duty we owe to the future  generations.     
 
Allocating  at least one additional  non-permanent  seat in the reformed  
Security  Council  to the Eastern  European  Regional  Group  remains  a priority  
for my country.   
 
During  the 77th session,  Bulgaria  is strongly  committed  to its financial  
obligations  to the United  Nations  and is concerned  about  the persisting  
liquidity  challenges,  which  undermine  the ability  of the Organization  toCheck  against  delivery!  
  7 implement  its mandates  and to carry  out its approved  program  of work.  We 
will continue  to support  the Secretary -General's  policies  to improve  the 
financial  situation  of the United  Nations.  Bulgaria  consistently  ranks  among  
the Member  States  that have  contributed  on time and in full to both the 
regular  and UN peacekeeping  budgets.   
 
EXCELLENCIES,   
LADIES  AND  GENTLEMEN,   
 
Allow  me to conclude  by sharing  with you our vision  of the way ahead.  We 
will have  to navigate  through  uncharted  waters.  If we build  upon  the 
consolidated  and unanimous  approach  of upholding  the principles  and the 
provisions  of the UN Charter,  we may exit the present  crises,  but a long way 
to the reestablishment   of the security  and the economic  stability  will follow  
after the war. The world  of tomorrow  will be very different  from what  we 
expected  it to be just not so long ago. Whether  we will be up to the challenge  
will depend  on our unity,  on our ability  to act together  and as one. To mitigate  
the negative  side effects  and re-adjust  our lives to the new realities  in the 
world,  and withstand  the rules -based  multilateralism,  with the United  Nations  
at its core.

Statement by H.E. Mr. Jeyhun Bayramov,  
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan ,  
at the General Debate of the 77th session of the UN General Assembly  
“A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”  
New York, 24 September 2022  
 
 
Mr. President,  
Mr. Secretary General,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
First, I would like to extend congratulations to His Excellency Csaba Kőrösi  on assuming 
Presidency of the 77th session of the General Assembly and wish him every success in this 
highly responsible capacity. Mr. Kőrösi can count on full support of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan throughout his tenure. I also wish to thank outgoing Pres ident, His Excellency 
Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his hard work over the past year.  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
 
Azerbaijan is well -known for its contribution to promoting intercultural and interfaith 
dialogue. The Baku Process launched in 2008 by the Government of Azerbaijan together 
with the UN Alliance of Civilizations, Council of Europe, UNESCO, ISESCO and others , 
has set standards and agendas for the dialogue and intercultural cooperation. The 
important role of the Baku Process in advocating for dialogue among cultures was 
recognized in the reports of the UN Secretary -General .  
 
Based on the successful experience of the Baku Process, Azerbaijan in partnership with 
the UN Alliance of Civilizations and ISESCO launched in June 2021 a new international 
initiative entitled “Peace4Culture” Global Call, the aim of which is to contribute to the 
sustainable peace , development and protection of cultural heritage. We believe that this 
initiative will be equally successful, and invite all countries and international organizations 
to join this project. 
 Dear  Colleagues,   
 
The world continues to face serious challenges that the COVID -19 pandemic has brought. 
Despite the fact that expanding vaccination rates and  increasing adaptivity of the global 
population to new realities give glimpse of hope for the post -COVID period, serious 
challenges remain.  
All immediat e and long -term challenges brought by the pandemic necessitate new 
mechanisms supported by high -level political engagement that would provide a 
comprehensive framework for global cooperation and solidarity.  
From the very beginning Azerbaijan in its both n ational and the NAM Chair capacities has 
been advocating for greater global solidarity to overcome the pandemic, and put forward a 
number of global initiatives to that end. T he initiative of President Ilham Aliyev, in his 
capacity as Chair of the Non -Align ed Movement, to convene a Special Session of the UN 
General Assembly in response to the COVID -19 pandemic, enjoyed broad support of the 
UN membership. On behalf of NAM Azerbaijan also tabled resolutions on ensuring equal, 
affordable, timely and universal a ccess to COVID -19 vaccines, which were adopted at the 
UN General Assembly and Human Rights Council with an overwhelming support of 
Member States.  
Along with effective vaccination campaign within the country, Azerbaijan has donated 
significant amount of CO VID-19 vaccines to the countries in need. We have provided 
international assistance to more than 80 countries to combat the pandemic .  
We will continue our endeavors aimed at further strengthening international cooperation in 
addressing the consequences of  the pandemic and consolidating efforts for global recovery 
from the COVID -19. The President of Azerbaijan, in this regard, has initiated the 
establishment of High -level UN Panel on post -pandemic global recovery, which will be 
among the topics to be elabor ated on at the upcoming Summit -level Meeting of the NAM 
Contact Group in response to COVID -19 to be held in Baku in coming months.  
Excellencies,  
Since gaining its independence Azerbaijan has made a long journey, transforming from a 
country, imposed with th e security challenges on its own soil, into a contributor to the global 
security. Along the way Azerbaijan has been a strong and reliable partner of the United 
Nations, staunchly supported it and actively contributed to its activities .  
Both in its nationa l capacity and as current Chair of the Non -Aligned Movement, Azerbaijan 
is keen to continue contributing to peace and security, strengthening the international legal 
order, and enhancing dialogue, global solidarity and multilateralism. 
 We also look forward  to the Summit of the Future, its inter -governmentally negotiated 
outcome and a New Agenda for Peace as an opportunity to reinvigorate global action, 
reflect on collective commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and multilateralism.  
Azerbaijan is fully committed to 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We launched 
the new development strategy up to 2030, which goes hand in hand with the 2030 Agenda. 
Over the last year Azerbaijan has progressed further in terms of SDG achievement and 
was ranked in top 50 countries in the UN 2022 Sustainable Development Report. 
Azerbaijan is among 12 countries, which submitted three Voluntary National Reviews in the 
High-Level Political Forum, held under the auspices of ECOSOC.   
We pursue transformational c hanges in remodeling  our economy to make transition to 
green and circular economy. The clean environment and green growth have been identified 
as one of the five priority areas of our new national development strategy. This transition 
stands high on our de velopment agenda despite the fact that the oil and gas sector plays 
a significant role in our economy . It is against this backdrop that the non -oil sector of 
Azerbaijan rose by 11 percent in the first half of 2022, triggering the increase in our GDP 
by 7.2  percent.   
Currently, Azerbaijan is one of the few countries worldwide gradually mainstreaming the 
sustainable energy in its development agenda, while being a reliable hydrocarbons 
exporter to the international markets.  We will increase our profile in this  regard, including 
through introducing new elements of alternative and renewable energy as well. A recently 
concluded EU -Azerbaijan MoU on a strategic partnership in the field of energy is a good 
example of Azerbaijan’s constructive input into global energ y security.  
Sustainability has also been mainstreamed in post -conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation 
activities in the liberated territories, as well. New cities and villages are now being built from 
the scratch by applying modern urban planning method s, the concepts of ""smart city"" and 
""smart village"".  After the war 3 billion USD have already allocated from the state budget 
for these purposes, and Azerbaijan is keen to invest even more in the future. The liberated 
area was designated a “green energy z one”.  
 
Positioned at the crossroads of North -South and East -West transport corridors, Azerbaijan 
is a rising transit country. C orridors and routes passing through Azerbaijan offer competitive 
advantages for the transport operators and businesses in terms of high -end infrastructure 
and fast, secure transit traffic .  
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
This year marks 30th anniversary of admission of the Republic of Azerbaijan to the 
membership in the United Nations. Since becoming part of the UN family, Azerbaijan has 
consistently demonstrated its strong commitment to the principles and purposes of the UN 
Charter and international law. 
 We joined the UN, when the very principles, which the UN stands for, have been blatantly 
violated in relation to Azerbaijan. In those difficult times the UN stood with Azerbaijan in 
defending the core values enshrined in its Charter.  
Azerbaijan has seriously suffered from the aggression by Armenia in the early 1990s, at 
the core of which were groundless territorial claims, misinterpretation of international law, 
fabricated historical narratives and racist motivations. Bac k then, the United Nations 
Security Council unanimously expressed its  support to the  sovereignty, territorial integrity, 
and inviolability of the internationally recognized borders  of Azerbaijan , and demand ed the  
withdrawal of all occupying forces from Aze rbaijani territories. So did the General 
Assembly.  
 
In course of aggression  Armenia occupied 20 percent of Azerbaijan’s territory. 20 thousand  
Azerbaijanis have been  killed, more than 1 million have become  refugees and IDPs. Almost 
4,000 citizens of Azerb aijan, both civilians and military, still remain missing in connection 
with the conflict.  
 
Armenia has inflicted long -term damage on the environment in Azerbaijan. Also, thousands 
of cultural heritage objects of Azerbaijan have been destroyed, plundered o r 
misappropriated by Armenia. Earlier this year, ISESCO has sent a technical mission to 
Azerbaijan to undertake a post -conflict State of Conservation Assessment of the Cultural 
Heritage in its liberated territories. For decades, Azerbaijan has called on Ar menia to 
support an independent, transparent UNESCO mission to assess and advise on the 
protection and preservation of cultural heritage in the region. Although Armenian 
occupation of Azerbaijan’s territory ended in 2020, a UNESCO mission has yet to arrive , 
and I once again publicly call for such a mission.  
 
The scale of violations and destructions demonstrates the clear intent and purpose to 
terrorize, kill and expel Azerbaijani civilians , and erase all traces of Azerbaijan from these 
territories.  
 
Within almost 30 years, Armenia, having committed ethnic cleansing, carried out illegal 
settlement policy by transferring Armenians en masse  from Armenia and third countries to 
the occupied terr itories of Azerbaijan in a blatant violation of international humanitarian law , 
with the aim of preventing Azerbaijanis from return to their places of origin, and securing 
the annexation of these territories.  
 
Conflict resolution efforts under the auspice s of the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe yielded no results.  
 
Almost 30 years on, in autumn 2020, Azerbaijan, in response to yet another large -scale 
military provocation of Armenia and  guided by the inherent rights conferred upon the 
Member States by the UN Charter, launched a counter -offensive operation . As a result, 
 Azerbaijan has  liberated its territories and three -decades -old armed conflict has been 
resolved by military and political means in line with the Trilateral Statement signe d by the 
leaders of Azerbaijan, Russia and Armenia on November 10, 2020.  
 
The Trilateral Statement announced the end of all military activities between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan . It set the parameters for consolidating peace in the region, such as complete 
withdrawal of all Armenian armed units from the territory of Azerbaijan; the return of 
displaced persons; and the unblocking of all economic and transport connections in the 
region . 
 
Azerbaijan has  now embarked upon unprecedented recovery and reconstruction activities 
in the liberated territories and prioritized  their full reintegration . Such activities aim at finally 
enabling hundreds of thousands of IDPs to return to their homes in safety and dignity , and 
ensure peaceful life in conflict -affected territories. The first families have recently returned 
to the Aghali village in the liberat ed Zangilan district of Azerbaijan.  
Azerbaijan is resolute to re -integrate its citizens of Armenian origin residing in conflict -
affected territories into its political, social, economic space, guaranteeing the same rights 
and freedoms with all the citizens  of Azerbaijan regardless of their ethnic, religious or any 
other affiliation. The Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan provides the solid legal 
framework in this regard.   
One of the major impediments to the ongoing recovery and reconstruction effort s and safe 
return of displaced persons is a massive contamination of liberated territories by landmines 
and other explosive devices , and continued refusal by Armenia to provide accurate and 
complete information on mined areas. Over the years of occupation of and during 
withdrawal of its forces from Azerbaijani territories Armenia heavily and indiscriminately 
contaminated those areas with mines and other explosive hazards. Since the signing of 
Trilateral Statement  more than 240 Azerbaijani civilians and mili tary were killed or seriously 
injured by mine explosions.  
Obtaining the maps of minefields along with the targeted and sustainable international 
technical and financial assistance to further strengthen and increase national mine action 
capacities and effo rts in Azerbaijan are critically important to save lives and strengthen 
peace. The UN sustainable support and adequate and predictable mine action funding are 
indispensable.  
 
Excellencies,  
 
Azerbaijan is committed to regional peace, stability and developme nt. Establishment of 
good neighborly relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan is a key for building secure, 
stable and prosperous South Caucasus through full -fledged regional normalization. 
 Along with carrying out  large -scale recovery and reconstruction works in the liberated 
territories , and pursuing reintegration of residents in conflict -affected territories , Azerbaijan 
has initiated the process of normalizing inter -State relations with Armenia based on mutual 
recognition and respect for each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within their state 
borders.  
 
Azerbaijan has, on numerous occasions, expressed its readiness to start negotiations on 
peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan , and has established its national delegation 
to that end.  
 
Equally, Azerbaijan has undertaken efforts to start the process of delimitation and 
demarcation of state borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan, unblocking transportation 
and communication links, including the establishment of the  Zang ezur Corri dor, which is a 
part of international transportation network .  
 
Notwithstanding  the increased dynamism in contacts, including direct dialogue between 
Armenia and Azerbaijan over past months, Armenia seems to stick to its past practice of 
imitation of negot iations , and instead of good faith implementation of its commitments, it 
frequently resorts to provocations and sabotage to exacerbate tensions and undermine 
ongoing normalization  process with Azerbaijan.  
Armenia has not fully withdrawn its armed forces from Azerbaijani territories as stipulated 
by November 10 Trilateral statement, and continues a variety of military activities within the 
territories of Azerbaijan , including planting landmines. Recently, massive number of anti -
personnel mines produ ced in Armenia in 2021, have been found in the Lachin district of 
Azerbaijan . 
 
Following a series of political and military provocations, especially after the fourth Brussels 
meeting between the leaders of the two countries, Armenia resorted to another large -scale 
military provocation along the undelimited state border line in the ni ght from 12 to 13 
September attempting to plant mines on the roads between the military positions of 
Azerbaijan, taking advantage of night time and complex terrain . 
Further on , Armenia, using weapons of different caliber, opened fire on Azerbaijani 
positio ns, which caused losses among the  military personnel of Azerbaijan, and inflicted 
significant damage upon its military infrastructure.  
Azerbaijan took adequate measures to neutralize threat against its sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, to ensure safet y of its personnel, as well as civilian personnel involved 
in reconstruction works in the area.  The armed forces of Azerbaijan demonstrated utmost 
restraint and professionalism , and limited to targeting exclusively fire points of Armenia with 
high precisio n weapons to suppress its attacks on the positions of Azerbaijan. 
 Armenia  clearly attempted a  further escalation  to manipulate the attention of international 
community . Thus, Armenia disregarded the ceasefire agreed on September 13 and 
continued shelling the territory of Azerbaijan, including with high -caliber weapons and 
artillery. As a result, Azerbaijan suffered further losses and casualties , included 80 
servicemen killed, 282 servicemen and 2 civilians wounded . 
  
Contrary to such  reckless acti ons of Armenia, Azerbaijan exercised utmost restraint, took 
several steps, including through contacts with relevant international partners, and 
demonstrated good faith and genuine will to restore the  ceasefire .  
 
Eventually the ceasefire was restored  effec tive of 8 pm  on September 14 through direct 
communication channels between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and is being maintained , as 
confirmed by both sides.  
 
In the aftermath of the escalation, Azerbaijan is engaged in addressing the humanitarian 
consequences and in this context  declared its willingness to return to Armenia remains of 
deceased military personnel on a unilateral basis , and informed the ICRC accordingly.  
 
Azerbaijan is not and cannot be interested in the tension.  As a matter of fact , latest 
hostilities erupted in close proximity of areas where i mpressive large -scale post -conflict 
investment, rehabilitation and reconstruction projects are underway.  
Furthermore, latest escalation of tension fits very well into the pattern we had observed 
over last 30 years from Armenia. Each time at the decisive stage to achieve a breakthrough 
Armenia resorted to similar serious provocation as a mean of escaping from responsibility 
of taking necessary decision s.  
 
We would ha ve wished that current leadership of Armenia is not following the path of its 
predecessors by deliberately closing for yet another time the window of opportunity for 
peace and security in the region.  
 
Azerbaijan is resolute in further repelling any threat  to its sovereignty and territorial integrity, 
as well as safety of its citizens,  and urges Armenia to refrain from further escalating the 
situation. Instead, Armenia has to constructively engage in the ongoing normalization 
process in order to establish p redictable stable situation in the region through establishment 
of good -neighborly relations . 
 
In this context, following the agreement reached at the fourth meeting held on August 31, 
2022 in Brussels of the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia with the Pres ident of the EU 
Council, Azerbaijan reiterated to Armenia its readiness to start practical work on the peace 
treaty without further delay. Immediately after the meeting, we proposed concrete date and 
venue to Armenia for such talks. 
 Two days ago we listened to the statement delivered here by the Prime Minister of Armenia. 
Regretfully, this was yet another evidence demonstrating that the Armenian side seems 
focused on continuing the confrontation instead of normalization. In Azerbaijan we believe 
that our region has seen enough confrontation , destruction and suffering. It is high time for 
both our nations to engage fully and wholeheartedly  in the post -conflict normalization, so 
we can finally turn over the tragic page of our history and start building a better future for 
our children. The commitment of Azerbaijan side is there. We hope that Armenia will finally 
reciprocate constructively an d engage genuinely into the negotiations .   
 
 
Excellencies,  
 
Having liberated its territories from a long -term foreign military occupation, Azerbaijan is 
determined to spare no effort towards their full reconstruction and re -integration in 
accordance with the highest possible standards. At the same time, our country will continue 
playing a role of a responsible member of international community in all relevant fields, 
whether it is contributing to global energy security, helping fight against COVID pandemic  
or promoting sustainable development. We believe that in a globalized world no country is 
an island. And we act accordingly.  
 
Thank you.", AZE,2022
 SGP_77_2022,"Mr President, Excellencies,  
 
Let me first congratulate His Excellency Csaba Kőrösi (Cha -ba 
Ke-re-shi) on assuming the Presidency of the 77th session of the 
General Assembly.  
 
I also commend His Excellency Abdulla Shahid for his stalwart 
leadership of the 76th session during a most challenging year.  
 
This General Assembly is taking place in the shadow of multiple 
concurrent crises.   
 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine flagrantly violates international 
law and the UN Charter and undermines the rules -based order.  
 
We are also deeply concerned about the potential annexation of 
more Ukrainian territory. The multilateral system, which has 
contributed greatly to global peace and security, is now being 
severely tested.At the same time,  super power rivalry continues to  sharpen. As 
we have seen in theatres from Europe to Asia this year, the risks 
of accidents, miscalculation, confrontation, an d outright conflict 
have escalated .  
 
The prospects for international cooperation have weakened and 
the temptation for unilateral ism has become stronger. But the 
need for concerted global cooperation has never been greater  or 
more urgent , given the range of transnational challenges we face 
today.   
 
Our r ecovery from  COVID -19 remains uneven  and fragile . The 
risk of a future and even more deadly  pandemic , “Disease X” , 
has risen.  
 
The global economy is entering a period of higher and 
prolonged inflation, and higher interest rates. Energy prices have 
soared. It will become harder to generate  the resources to 
address long-term issues .Societies continue to grapple with  greater division,  disruption, 
and polarisation. Without cohesion, trust , or even an ability to 
agree on facts, the will and unity  needed for societies to confront 
our challenges  will be undermined .  
 
The climate crisis is a clear and present threat.  
 
Our global commons such as water and biodiversity are also 
deteriorating rapidly.  
 
Our global food supply is at risk.  
 
To make things worse,  all these threats and crises are occurring 
concurrently; interacting with  and compounding  each other.  
 
For instance, the Secretary -General has spoken of a triple crisis 
of food, fuel, and finance. The i mpact of these crises on ordinary 
people  and their livelihoods  has been severe, especially in 
developing countries. We see this in the devastating impact of 
the floods in Pakistan to worsening food insecurity in parts of 
Africa.The post-World War II era of relative stability and prosperity  
has come to an end . A ne w world order is being shaped, and the 
moment of delivery is always the most dangerous.  
 
Will we have a more divided, less prosperous , and less peaceful 
world?   
 
Or can we strengthen multilateralism and the UN to deal with 
the challenges of the future, uphold and strengthen the rules -
based international system, and jointly harness the opportunities 
offered by new technologies  – digital, biology and renewable 
energy  – to create a new era of peace and prosperity?  
 
Singapore believes that the only way forward is to uphold the 
inclusive and rules -based multilateral system that has 
underwritten  peace and progress  since World War II .  
 
This is also why we worked with a cross -regional group of 
countries to establish the Forum of Small States, or FOSS, in 
1992.We started with 16 countries. This year, we celebrate the 30th 
anniversary of FOSS. 108 countries – a majority at the UN – are 
proud members.   
 
FOSS has always been a champion of the UN and rules -based 
multilateralism.  
 
It gives us a collective stake and voice in the global commons, a 
means to safeguard our interest s, and a system where we have 
sovereign equality and disputes can be settled peacefully in 
accordance with international law.  
 
Indeed , the profound importance of multilateralism and 
international law is why Singapore has strongly condemned 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  
 
The security and even existence of Singapore – and many others 
– depends on the international community  upholding the 
fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.If we do not protect these principles, there is no basis for 
countries – big and small – to cooperate on an equal footing.  
Small states especially must not allow the world to regress to 
one where ‘might is right’.   
 
While  the rules -based  multilateral system is not perfect, it is by 
far our best option  in addressing transnational challenges  and 
managing the global commons .  
 
This was exemplified by the pivotal adoption of the UN 
Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, 40 years ago. It 
brought order and predictability to the governance of our oceans 
and provided a universal legal framework in which all States can 
work toge ther.  
 
The geopolitical reality today makes  it harder to forge consensus 
on such a framework.  
 
But as our experience with COVID -19 has shown,  multilateral 
cooperation is the only way forward.Ultimately , we share this planet. Despite our differences, o ur 
destinies are inter -woven , and  no one is safe until all of us are 
safe. This holds for pandemics, as it does for climate change, the 
conservation of the oceans , and many  other shared  challenges.  
 
Singapore will do our part.  
 
We are honoured that Ambassador Rena Lee  serve s as the 
President of the BBNJ  conference, which is negotiating  a treaty 
under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of 
marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.  
 
We call on  all delegations to expedite the conclusion of a robust 
and future -proof BBNJ treaty.  
 
There is much more we can do  to re-energise and transform the 
UN-based multilateral system  to new realities and challenges.  
 
I commend the leadership of the Secretary -General in putting 
forward a bold and ambitious “Common Agenda” to  do so .I will focus on three areas in our global commons where there is 
an urgent need to build resilience :  
 
Climate change and food insecurity, global health and pandemic 
preparedness, and digital transformation and cybersecurity.  
 
Climate change remains the most pressing challenge confronting 
humanity today , as we have seen from the more frequent 
occurrences of extreme weather events  and the devastation that 
they have wrought .   
 
We need a sustained and ambitious global response. Continued 
commitment by countries to the Paris Agreement and Glasgow 
Climate Pact is critical.   
 
We also need to step up cooperat ion in the transition to net zero . 
This will likely be the biggest  socio -economic transformation 
since the Industrial Revolution.Both  will require considerable economic restructur ing, 
technological breakthroughs, investments , and behavioural 
changes.  
 
The UN -led multilateral system will be key in pulling everyone 
together to row in the same direction and not leave anyone 
behind.  
 
Singapore , as a small , low-lying,  and alternative -energy 
disadvantaged island nation,  is especially vulnerable to climate 
change and sea -level rise.  
 
Our impact on global emissions is very small, but we take our 
climate action obligations seriously.  
 
We have just raised our climate ambition to achieve net zero 
emissions by or around mid -century. A comprehensive strategy 
to green the economy is taking shape , and we will raise carbon 
taxes progressively from 2024.We will do our part to build a comprehensive green finance 
ecosystem and facilitate the regional journey to net zero.   
 
We are supporting industry efforts to build the infrastructure for 
a voluntary carbon credit market in Asia.   
 
We are also building capabilities in environmental risk 
management in the financial sector and providing grants to 
defray the costs of green and sus tainability -linked loans and 
bonds.  
 
An adjacent issue is food insecurity. Climate change, the 
pandemic, and the war in Ukraine have all exacerbated the threat 
to food security.   
 
According  to a UN report, as many as 828 million people were 
affected by hunger last year  — 46 million more from 2020 and 
150 million more from 2019.  
 
We must  reverse this concerning  trend.First, we need to  ensur e that food supply  chains remain open  and 
operate smoothly .  
 
Second,  we need to pursue innovation and leverage  technology 
to adapt to new challenges.  For example , working together to 
develop climate -resilient food systems, while developing  the 
necessary precautions on food safety.  
 
There is  much scope for  multilateral cooperation  on capacity -
building  and the development of global norms and standards.  
 
Next  — it is essential  to build a more robust global health 
architecture to protect future generations.  
 
After COVID -19, there will be other pandemics and major 
health emergencies. In my view,  COVID -19 is perhaps a dress 
rehearsal for a worse pandemic to come.  
 
We must be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess, 
and respond to pandemics in a coordinated and effective fashion.We have a collective responsibility to rectify the longstanding 
under -investment in pandemic preparedness, among st other 
global public goods.  
 
Singapore has supported multilateral initiatives to strengthen 
global health security.  
 
We will continue to support the COVAX Facility, and we have 
contributed to the establishment of a financial intermediary fund 
for pandemic preventio n, preparedness and response hosted by 
the World Bank.  
 
Lastly, we must enhance international cooperation to harness the 
opportunities of the digital revolution.   
 
Digital transformation  does not take place in a vacuum. It  must  
be navigated  in the context of intersecting issues  — geopolitical 
tensions, technol ogical bifurcation, cybersecurity threats, and 
the digital divide.The world has made significant progress in development by 
operating on a single technology stack.  
 
Interconnectedness and interoperability brought us together, 
lowered costs, and spurred innovation and the cross -fertilisation 
of ideas.   
 
But a fractured w orld threaten s to undo all our good work.   
 
We need an open and inclusive global framework to harness and 
optimise the opportunities of digital transformation, while 
effectively addressing its challenges.  
 
A zero -sum, exclusionary, bifurcated approach benefits no one. 
An erosion of trust and an atmosphere of confrontation will only 
breed cyber threats and malicious cyber activities.  
 
We must also ensure that all States, particularly small states, 
developing  and least developed countries benefit from the digital 
revolution and not be left further behind .Singapore  fully supports the Secretary -General’s proposal for a 
Global Digital Compact , which has received  strong support from 
Member States.  
 
We are honoured that Ambassador  Burhan Gafoor serve s as 
Chair of the Open -Ended Working Group on security of and in 
the use of information and communications technologies .  
 
The consensus adoption of the Working Group’s first Annual 
Progress Report in July  is a welcome sign that  multilateralism 
can still deliver meaningful progress on the global commons.  
 
Mr President, Excellencies , 
 
To conclude — this is a moment where  multilateralism must be 
defended and fortified.   
 
Our responses to these myriad opportunities and challenges must 
remain rooted in the foundational tenets of multilateralism, 
including adherence to the UN Charter and international law.I remain an optimist and believe that we are actually on the cusp 
of an era of profound technological breakthrough s, one  that will 
equip humanity with unimaginably powerful tools.  
 
It is in the world’s interest – and in our own long -term interests 
– to set aside our differences, address the challenges of the 
global commons, and harvest the emerging opportunities 
provided by technology.  
 
Ultimately, as Member States, we have as much responsibility to 
each other  and to our citizens :  
 
To work together, and to improve, adapt , and strengthen the 
multilateral system that we have painstakingly built over the 
past 77 years, so that our people can lead better, more secure, 
and more peaceful lives.  
 
Thank you.", SGP,2022
 BLR_77_2022,"STATEMENT  
by His Excellency Vladimir Makei  
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus  
77th session of the UN General Assembly  
General debate  
 
Check against delivery  
 
 
Mr. President,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
For more than six months, the world has been living in the ""shadow"" of 
the conflict in Ukraine.  It is adversely affect ing so many people on the planet.  
The conflict like the COVID -19 pandemic that preceded it has once again 
laid bare the downside of global interdependence.   
This session provides a unique oppo rtunity to take stock of the situation.  
Let us , in a very honest and unbiased manner , answer two questions.  The 
answers to them – as well as the ensuing necessary action – is what all people 
around the globe expect from us, the UN Member States.  
The first is what were the root causes of the conflict in Ukraine?  
The second is what needs to be done to stop the conflict and prevent 
similar events from recurring  in the future ? 
Mr. President,  
We are convinced that the conflict in Ukraine stems from a wider 
geop olitical chaos, whose causes must be sought in the events that took place 
30 years ago.  
History teaches us that epoch -making wars that resulted in unfair an d 
humiliating peace terms contained the seeds of future conflict s. 
Let us take a look at w hat kind o f peace was established after the end of 
the last epochal confrontation – the Cold War?  
The so -called “winners” , apparently influence d by euphoria , did not 
consider it necessary to draw on examples from the past.  
After all, they could have followed the pa th of Alexander I, Metternich 
and Castlereagh.  These great peacemakers of the early 19th century effectively 
integrated their adversary into a new security system, the Concert of Europe, 
thereby bringing a lasting peace to Europe that would endure for deca des to 
come.  
Likewise, they could have taken inspiration from the pattern of 
cooperation established during World War II by the “Great Three Men” – 
Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill , who forged arrangements that significantly 
narrowed chances for great powe rs to wage wars against each other.  
Notwithstanding, the Western policymakers of the early 1990s, 
unfortunately, chose the most inglorious and unpromising option . Namely, it 
was the path of the 1919 -type Versailles diplomats keen on trampling upon 
their pr incipled opponent.  
To begin with, the Cold War ended not even with an official treaty, but 
with some kind of ""gentlemen's agreements"" and declarations.   
As the subsequent events revealed, the so -called ""winning"" side did not 
respect them. In fact, the  arrangements stood as nothing more than a ""Versailles 
2.0."".  
The West showed itself selfish by offering to the post -Soviet states only 
one path, that of its satellites. In an effort to embed th e status the West staked 
on the expansion of one of its key Cold Wa r-era institutions – the North 
Atlantic Treaty Alliance.  NATO’s eastward expansion occurred despite the 
arrangements achieved with the West, including by the Soviet leaders . 
Furthermore, the West overlooked the legitimate security interests of both 
Russia and Belarus.  
 In this regard one cannot fail to recall the outstanding American diplomat 
George Kennan, whose foreign policy prophecies Western policymakers so 
much admire. The point is why they failed to heed yet just another of Kennan's 
famous warnings when in 1996 the diplomat had denounced NATO expansion 
as ""a strategic mistake of potentially epic proportions ?"" 
With its drive to enlarge NATO, the West has essentially trampled upon 
the indivisibility of security, the vital principle , which states that one party must 
not seek to achieve  its own security at the expense of other  parties . 
The peacemakers in 1815 and 1945 well grasped that logic, whereas the 
world leaders in 1919 and 1991 refused to embrace it. 
NATO's involvement in the illegal wars in Yugosla via, Iraq, Libya and 
Syria, in addition to the Alliance's attempts to encroach on some historical 
Eastern Slavic and adjacent lands predetermined for the Versailles 2.0.  the fate 
of the first Versailles.  
Therefore, it is the collective West that should fully bear the 
responsibility for the ongoing bloodshed in Ukraine.   
It was exactly the West that made this conflict inevitable – not only 
through its  decision to expand NATO, but also by its refusal to consider the 
proposals that came from its opponents.  After all, s uch proposals  did come . 
The questions arises: what to do?  
Indeed, in 2009, Russia invited all interested parties to sign a new 
European security treaty that would de jure  wrap up the Cold War.  The West 
rejected the proposal.  
In 2017, it was Presid ent of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko who came up 
with the idea to hold a global security dialogue and proposed Minsk as a venue 
for negotiations.  The o pponents let this initiative go unnoticed as well.  
Last December, the Russian Federation has made yet another attempt to 
reach an agreement with the West on the issue of European security. As before, 
the West remained deaf to the new Russian proposal. 
What explains this “rejectionist” stance  by the West ? 
The key problem  stems from the ongoing clash at the glo bal level 
between the two incompatible visions of the world order – concentric  and 
polycentric.  
The West wants to establish a concentric or a unipolar world, ruled from 
one center and subordinated to the interests of a Western hegemon.  
Most other countries , in turn, want to create a polycentric or a multipolar 
world, with no single center of control, in which no one imposes its visions, 
interests and values on others.  
The West dominated the world for the past five centuries . Hence, it 
believes that it can go on with this kind of his tory indefinitely.  
As for us, we are deeply convinced that the world has changed and that 
neo-colonialism in any form is no longer an acceptable and viable option.  
Five centuries ago, when the West was just beginning its global as cent, 
the world came to witness the Copernican revolution of knowledge.  That 
revolution took place, first and foremost, in the minds of people of that time, 
who found it difficult to come to terms with the postulate that it was not the 
Earth, but the Sun , which stood at the center of the solar system.  
A similar ""Copernican"" paradigm shift must occur today.  As was the case 
half a millennium ago, it must take place in the minds , too. This time around it 
must occur in the minds of the West ’s political mainstre am. 
The West must, at last, realize a number of truths.  
First.  International relations do not revolve around a single, namely , the 
Western center of power.  
Second.  The w orld’s history has no end, because it is not an inexorable 
movement of all countries to wards the so -called ""liberal democracy"".  
Third.  The world is  a too complex  structure as to reduce all its problems 
to a confrontation between the so-called ""democracies"" and ""autocracies"".  
We have not seen that this kind of realization has registered with the West 
so far . What we have seen instead is the destruction stubbornly pursued by the 
West, including self -destruction.  
Economic sanctions are almost the only tool in the West ’s foreign policy 
toolkit . One cannot fail to get an impression that the very f act the sanctions 
have been launched serves as an indicator of the ir effectiveness for Europe and 
the United States.  And, in this sense what we witness is a substitution of 
concepts.  The key objective has not been achieved, whereas the sanctions keep 
on living a life of their own.  
What common sense  does the West invest in economic sanctions it 
imposes against other countries?  
Without any trace of hesitation , the goal has been stated loud and clear – 
to achieve a change of power through food riots.  
This c alculation has generally turned out to be a failure.  Most countries 
have not joined the effort to implement the sanctions. Many states under 
sanctions such as Belarus and Russia are to a large extent self-sufficient.  
Importantly, the sanctions have given us a  powerful impetus to develop hidden 
internal reserves  and reinvigorate regional integration.  
Undoubtedly, we will weather the “storm” . We will survive in the same 
manner as the free -loving Cuba has been surviving illegal sanctions for more 
than six decade s!  
Nonetheless , the sanctions led to the two negative implications, which 
their sponsors could hardly have anticipated.  
First, they reduced the supply of fertilizer s and food from the countries  
under sanctions. As a result, those who suffer the most are the poorest people in 
developing countries . Suffice it to say that prices in these countries have 
skyrocketed by 300 percent over the last half a year, while Africa is facing 
fertilizer shortages to the tune of over 2 million tons.  
Secondly, which is truly  anecdotal, the sanctions, through a boomerang 
effect, hit the West itself . And, no matter how some may swagger today, 
ordinary people in Europe will have to freeze in the coming winter.  
It is high time for Western countries to resort to common sense and r eturn 
to dialogue and cooperation!  
Even in the current situation Belarus  stands ready to embrace dialogue 
and cooperation  on equal  terms , without any preconditions and pressure!  
Mr. President,  
Belarus speaks a lot about the conflict in Ukraine and takes ev ery 
opportunity to do so.  
We cannot do otherwise. The conflict is happening at our very doorstep.  
We are extremely sad dened to witness how the fraternal Ukrainian people 
became a victim of the collective West’s geopolitical games.  
We are convinced that th e origins of Ukraine's specific problems should 
be sought in 2004, when the West managed to carry out the first ""colo ur 
revolution"" in this country. The second revolution, a decade later, firmly 
secured the  anti-Russia  status for Ukraine.  
Instigated by the  United States and their allies, Ukraine has been 
exterminating  the people of Donbass for eight years for no other reason than 
that the local people want to speak their native language, Russian.  
But the West does not need Ukraine, neither as a member of NA TO nor 
as a member of the European Union. The new patrons  simply used it in their 
own ""big game"" against Russia.  
Today, Ukraine is paying the price in blood because its politicians bought 
into this deception and disregarded  the historical brotherhood of th e three East 
Slavic peoples — Belarusians, Russians and Ukrainians.  
But it's never too late to admit and correct mistakes!  
For Belarus, which itself went through the genocide of the Belarusian 
people during the Second World War, it is unbearably painful to  see the chaos 
in the neighboring country and the suffering of ordinary Ukrainians. 
 
Ever since 2014, we have been making every possible effort to bring 
peace to Ukraine.  It was Belarus that became associated with peace in Donbas 
when the Minsk agreements were adopted in 2014 -2015.   
Right after the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine last February, it was the 
President of Belarus who managed to get the parties to the conflict sit down at a 
negotiating table, once again on Belarus’ soil.  Belarus hosted t hree successful 
rounds of Ukrainian -Russian negotiations, which opened up real prospects for 
bringing the conflict  to an end . Unfortunately, this process has since stalled.  
 
We remain deeply convinced that both a ceasefire agreement and a 
comprehensive strategi c peace settlement around Ukraine in a broad context of 
regional and global security can be achieved only through negotiation. There is 
no alternative to talks!  Otherwise, we will all get a new third Versailles.  
As a neighbor and an affected country, Belar us should be part and parcel 
of a negotiation process and of final security guarantees.  
Mr. President,  
We very much hope that the tragic events in Ukraine will compel the 
collective West to realize rather quicker that changes in international relations 
are irreversible.  
The sooner this happens, the sooner peace can be brought to Ukraine  and 
other hot  spots , and the sooner we can lay the foundation for a new just world 
order.  
Moreover, a s a crucial step in this process we view a global security 
dialogue in t he true spirit of San Francisco, whose urgency the President of 
Belarus clearly stated as far back as 5 years  ago. 
We have consistently highlighted the key role of great powers in this 
effort.  Unfortunately, we ought to ascertain that today they hear and u nderstand 
each other poorly.  There is not the slightest hint that they are ready to move 
away from the recriminations.  
Perhaps the time has come for the countries representing the developing 
world to collectively take the lead on global security with all of the energy and 
dynamism, which they had displayed with great success nearly half a century 
ago in advancing the idea of a New International Economic Order . 
We believe that exactly now  the Non -Aligned Movement and BRICS, as 
well as the regional integratio n unions  are on the rise  to get involved directly in 
matters of global peace . 
It is true that today, unfortunately, we do not have at our disposal a clear 
concept for safeguarding peace and security of our planet insofar as the world 
has become so complex a structure that a multitude of diverse challenges defy 
any framework of a single design.  What is more, the mechanisms for 
neutralizing these global challenges that were put in place in the framework of 
preceding geopolitical realities lag behind with adeq uate decisions or stall 
altogether.  
The task facing today the whole of humanity’s responsible part is to 
ensure that our civilization would not be destroyed while we transition to a new 
multipolar world order.  
This is exactly what must be the area for our common priority action, 
including at the United Nations.  
It is in this direction, provided we want to survive at all, where we must 
seek consensus and promptly forge new adequate response mechanisms.  
It is for the sake of this objective that we must at onc e cease mutually 
destructive rhetoric  and put an end to f atal total confrontation  that leave no 
room for diplomatic efforts.  
It is only up for world leaders with great responsibility to achieve this, for 
those who, in the figurative expression of Henry Kis singer, ""possess a sense of 
direction and mission.""  Leaders of these qualities are bound to emerge on the 
world stage.  
Our present state of mind was well captured by Martin Luther King more 
than half a century ago  in the following phrase  Quote:  “We are now  faced with 
the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of 
now, in the unfolding life and history. There is such a thing as being too late.” 
Unquote.  
Let us act – lest it becomes too late!  
Belarus, for its part, stands ready to play a role of a  vigorously engaged 
and responsible stakeholder in security processes  at the global and regional 
level s alike . 
Thank you for your kind attention.", BLR,2022

of the Republic of San Marino  
H.E. Mr. Luca Beccari  
 
At the General Debate of the 77th Session of the UN General Assembly  
New York, 2 4 September 20 22 
 
 
 
 
 
Mr. President,  
Mr Secretary -General,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
On behalf of the Government of the Republic of San Marino, I would like to 
congratulate H.E. Csaba Kőrösi  on his election as President of the 7 7th Session 
of the UN General Assembly and to wish him a f ruitful work.  
The Republic of San Marino supports the priorities of your programme and 
ensures you, Mr. President, full cooperation in all works of the General 
Assembly.  
I would also like to extend my special thanks to Secretary General António 
Guterres for his energy and determination in leading the United Nations in these 
difficult and challenging times . 
Mr. President,  
I am grateful for the theme chosen for this Session: “ A watershed moment: 
transformative solutions to interlocking challenges” .  
It gives Member States the opportunity to constructively contribute to the work 
of the General Assembly.  
The increasingly evident interrelationships among global challenges highlight  the 
need for Member States, today more than ever, to work together to overcome 
difficulties.  
It is clear that there is a link between multilateralism  and global challenges, the 
scope of which goes beyond the capacity of each individual State, even the most 
powerful or technologically advanced, to face them on its own.  
Preserving the values of multilateralism and international cooperation, which 
underpi n the United Nations Charter and Agenda 2030 for Sustainable 
Development, is of fundamental importance for promoting and supporting 
peace and security, development and human rights.   
The Republic of San Marino considers it essential to continue to reaffir m its 
collective commitment to multilateralism, in particular in the framework of the 
General Assembly, as the most representative body of the United Nations on 
account of its deeply democratic nature, universal participation and undisputed 
legitimacy.  
How ever, multilateralism cannot be a mere statement of collective intentions, 
but it must translate into concrete actions to improve people's lives and leave 
nobody behind.  
 
Mr. President,  
We are facing difficult times, with an unprecedented level of violenc e, mass 
atrocities and displacement.   
The armed conflicts across the globe cause immense suffering to millions of 
civilians.  
The war of aggression against Ukraine  brought dramatic consequences for the 
civilian population, including civilian death, the destruction of vital 
infrastructure s, and massive displacement. 
The aggression against Ukraine has been strongly condemned by the 
international community.  
The Genera l Assembly Resolution  “Aggression against Ukraine”  demand s that 
Russia immediately stop its military aggression, and unconditionally withdraw all 
forces from the entire territory of Ukraine, and fully respect Ukraine’s territorial 
integrity, sovereignty an d independence within its internationally recognised 
borders .  
San Marino has decided to cooperate within the framework of international 
structures and mechanisms, at the top of which is the United Nations 
Organization, because it believes in the strength of dialogue, democracy and 
respect for others.   
In line with our values, the Captains Regent of the Republic of San Marino , in 
Their message at the opening of the session of the Parliament  last July, called on 
all parties involved in the Ukraine conflict to renounce the use of force and to 
reopen the channels of dialogue and negotiation so that politics and diplomacy 
may prevail in the management of this crisis.  
No one should remain indifferent to war, but rather we should all work 
responsibly to create the conditions for dialogue and peace with the full 
involvement of international institutions.  
 
Mr. President,  
San Marino is deeply concerned by the still ongoing  armed conflicts across the 
globe .   
We reaffirm our commitment to the principle of the Responsibility to Protect 
which is essential in the prevention of atrocity crimes.   
Accountability is indeed another factor that plays an important role in preventing 
and stopping such crimes.  
The Republic of San Marin o reaffirms its full commitment to the obligations 
under human and humanitarian law, such as the Convention on the Prevention 
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Rome Statute and the Geneva 
Conventions.  
San Marino reaffirms its full support to the  International Criminal Court, whose 
work is crucial in the fight against impunity for genocide and crimes against 
humanity and it represents one of the core elements for the implementation of 
the Responsibility to Protect.  
The ICC, through its work, fosters accountability and thus promotes prevention 
and reconciliation.  
The Republic of San Marino would also like to reiterate its support for initiatives 
such as the ACT Group’s Code of Conduct regarding Security Council action 
against genocide, war crim es or crimes against humanity and the French and 
Mexican declaration on voluntary restraint use of the veto by the Permanent 
Members of the Security Council.  
 
Mr. President,  
Children and youth are uniquely – and often disproportionately – affected by 
conflicts and atrocities.   
San Marino stresses the need of strengthening the child protection capacities and 
to put children and youth at the center of efforts to prevent atrocities.  
At the same time, we also encourage member States to adopt the relevant 
instruments  on the protection of children, including the Paris Principles and the 
Safe Schools Declaration.   
Being part of the Group of Friends of Children and Armed Conflict (CAAC), 
San Marino is particularly worried for the difficulties in the implement ation of 
child protection activities in armed conflict situations.  
San Marino commends the dedication of the Special Representative for Children 
and Armed Conflict and of her Office and appreciates the engagement of all the 
child protection personnel and partners involved.  
Moreover, San Marino is committed to the protection of women and girls, and 
to supporting the prevention of sexual and gender -based violence, including 
conflict -related sexual violence .  
In addition, persons with disabilities face addit ional risks and vulnerabilities in 
situations of armed conflict. Their needs should be duly taken into account and 
barriers to access information, evacuation, and emergency assistance should be 
lifted.  
San Marino is deeply disturbed and firmly condemns the growing number of 
deliberate attacks against schools, hospitals and places of worship. 
We also firmly condemn attacks against journalists , humanitarian workers, 
human rights defenders and peacekeepers.  
These stakeholders and civil society actors can play an important role for 
reconciliation and for the prevention and early warning mechanisms and should 
therefore be supported and protected.  
 
Mr. President,  
Today the threat of nuclear weapons being used is much higher than it has been 
in the last decades.  We condemn the Russian Federation’s dangerous nuclear 
rhetoric: any threat of use of nuclear weapons is unacceptable and of the utmost 
concern.    
What is needed today is a steady and genuine commitment to international 
institutions and to disarmament.  
With this spirit, San Marino ha s participated in the 10th Review Conference of 
the Non -Proliferation Treaty and in the First Meeting of State parties to the 
Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons earlier this year.  
We regret that, at this critical time , the 10th Review Conference of the Non -
Proliferation Treaty was not able to adopt its final document . San Marino will 
continue to work for the full implementation of this fundamental instrument.  
San Marino welcomes the positive outcome of the First Meeting of State parties 
to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear  Weapons  and urge s all States 
committed to our final goal of a world without such weapons  to join the TPNW.  
Only honoring and reinvigo rating our multilateral agreements will we be able to 
put humanity on a new path towards a world free of nuclear weapons.  
 
Mr. President,  
Since 1945, the world is witnessing the highest number of violent conflicts. 
Forced displacement has continued to grow in 2021 and 2022 while refugees 
were at the highest number. The war in Ukraine created one of the largest refugee 
crises of modern time.  
More than seven  million refugees ha ve fled Ukraine (most of whom are women 
and children), and a further seven  million ha ve been displaced inside the country. 
This refugee crisis confronts each member State with its responsibilities.  
The people of San Marino , guardian of the century -old tradition of peace and 
solidarity, open ed the doors to the Ukraine refugees.  
Since the beginning of the war, the Republic of San Marino has welcomed more 
than 300 Ukrainian refugees, equal to 1% of the entire  Sammarinese population, 
thanks  to the solidarity of public and private institutions , NGOs  and with the 
help of many volunteers.   
Together with the refugee crisis, the  impacts of the conflict s may lead to a global 
food crisis .  
Food insecurity affects the lives of millions of people across the world and is 
mainly concentrated in conflict -affected regions. The vast majority of stunted 
children live in Countries affected b y violence and conflicts.  
Armed conflicts displace farmers and can destroy agricultural assets and food 
stocks. Furthermore, they disrupt markets and vital services for the food systems.  
The ongoing war in Ukraine is disrupting supply chains and further affecting 
prices of grain, fertilizer and energy. In the first half of 2022, this caused further 
food price increases.  
As reported by The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2022, the 
number of people unable to afford a healthy  diet around the world rose by 112 
million to  almost 3.1 billion, reflecting the impacts of rising  consumer food prices 
during the pandemic.  
The COVID -19 pandemic has further expanded the fragilities in our agri -food 
systems and the  inequalities in our societies, and increased world hunger and 
severe food  insecurity.  
At the  same time, we also should not underestimate the effects of climate chan ge 
and climate disasters in aggravating food insecurity.  
For all th ese reasons, it is extremely important to keep food security on our 
agenda and to continue to incentivize  sustainable  production, supply and 
consumption of nutritious  foods  in order to make healthy diets less costly  and 
more affordable for all . 
Moreover, as promoter of the resolution which established the 29 of September 
as International Day of Awareness of Food  Loss and Waste, San Marino firmly 
believe s that the fight against food loss and waste will contribute  to promote 
food security and welcome s all the initiatives aiming at developing  awareness in 
such responsible behaviors.  
 
Mr. President ,  
It is widely acknowledged that the COVID -19 crisis had a negative impact on 
global efforts to realize the Sustainable Development Goals .  
At the end of 2021, the deaths caused by COVID -19 were nearly 15 million. 
With the overwhelming of the global hea lth systems and the disruption of many 
essential health services, the pandemic undermined years of progress fighting 
other diseases , in particular in developing countries .  
Compared with the pre -pandemic level, an additional 75  million to 95 million 
people will live in extreme poverty in 2022 .  
Billions of chil dren significantly missed out on schooling and over 100 million 
more  children fell below the minimum reading proficiency level . 
Despite some encouraging signs, t he global economy recovery struggles to grow 
due to COVID -19 variants and continued vaccine inequity, together with rising 
inflation,  major supply -chain disruptions, policy uncertainties, and unsustainable 
debt in developing  countries .  
The impact of climate change continues to be felt across the world. COVID -19 
further  delayed the urgent ly needed transition to greener economies.  Demand 
for coal, oil and gas rebounded with the  economy in 2021  and will bring over the 
current decade an increase of global emissions by almost 14%.   
If current trends continue, the Earth could lose the natural wealth of its 
ecosystems, which would in turn jeopardize global food security, water supplies, 
and livelihoods.  
 
Mr. President,  
The interconnection of the global crisis – COVID -19 pandemic, the climate 
change, t he armed conflicts across the globe  put at great risk the achievement of 
the SDGs by 2030.  
As the Secretary General called for in Our Common Agenda, a renewed 
commitment to international cooperation  is needed , but the  United Nations 
must adapt quickly to the new global challenges, in order  to be more effective 
in carrying out its mandate.  
Reforms must remain at the centre of our actions because they are crucial to 
future world stability and maintenance of international peace and security .  
We believe that the Security Council reform should be an objective of all member 
States . This reform goal can be achieved only through a continuous dialogue 
among the States and the awareness that overcoming the respective initial 
positions is essential to negotiate the broadest agreement possible.  
 
In co nclusion, Mr. President,  
A stronger multilateralism is essential if we want to build fair, just and peaceful 
societies, where young people can live in dignity, women can have the same 
opportunities as men, and where all minorities and vulnerable groups are 
protected.  
I believe th at the General Debate is an important opportunity to renew our 
commitment to a stronger United Nations Organization, capable of coordinating 
economic, social and environmental policies and translating them into effective 
action at all levels.    
The Republ ic of San Marino, in accordance with its history and its tradition of 
freedom and democracy, firmly believes in this mandate and will support any 
action that helps strengthen the United Nations in this process.  
 
Thank you for your attention.", SMR,2022

Mr. President,  
Mr. Secretary-General,  
Excellencies,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
 
Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. Peace Be Upon You All, and a Good Afternoon.  
 I have the great honour to convey the warm regards of His Majesty Sultan Haji 
Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah,  Sultan and Yang Di -Pertuan of Brunei 
Darussalam to this year’s General Assembly.  
 
At the outset, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Csaba Kőrösi for 
assuming the Presidency of the Seventy -Seventh session of this Assembly.  
 
Also, our deep appreciation to His Excellency Abdulla  Shahid for his contribution 
and efforts in bringing multilateralism, which is an important and fundamental 
principle of our work at the United Nations, to the forefront during his presidency.  
 Mr. President,  
 
While it is good to be back in New York to del iver Brunei’s statement in person 
after a  years absence, this year’s Debate continues to take place amidst global 
uncertainties and challenges that test our individual and collective resilience.  
 
It has been almost three years since we first heard of CO VID-19, and whilst we 
are still feeling its effects, many of us are now looking towards a post -pandemic 
world.  
 However, a key and crucial factor to achieving this would be a successful 
vaccination programme and by having vaccine equity. Lest we forget, t he WHO’s 
mantra that says, “ No one  is safe until everyone  is safe”.2 Unfortunately, as of June this year, only 58 out of 194 countries have achieve the 
70% complete vaccination target set by the WHO, whilst the others have not.  
 
Although initial challenge s faced regarding supply and manufacture of vaccines 
that resulted in delays have been addressed, we continue to see many countries 
still facing problems in getting their allocated vaccines.  
 
While we recognise the role COVAX has played in this global hea lth emergency, 
we also see the continued need to address the fundamental issue of vaccine 
inequity that has continued to impede supply and distribution. In this regard, we 
need to develop a more effective and more resilient global health infrastructure as part of our preparedness to face possible future global health emergencies.  
 More efforts are also needed to address the impact from the pandemic, like mental health, a condition that is often taken lightly even before the pandemic. This is 
important as it  can result in a huge economic burden to the countries concerned in 
the future.  
 
We in Brunei have come to recognise the need to include this in our post -pandemic 
recovery efforts. As such, we have introduced a five -year Multisectoral Mental 
Health Action  Plan, in addition to also working on a regional basis in the East Asia 
Summit mechanism in promoting better mental health and well -being.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Climate change is yet another challenge the world has been facing even prior to 
the pandemic, and it  is one which continues to be a real and existential threat today 
which, if left unaddressed, can lead to another global emergency.   
 In 2015, the world came together on two landmark agreements namely the Paris Accord which sets a target to limit global warming by 1.5 degrees and global greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the 200 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, which aims, among ot hers, to reach zero hunger. I believe these 
two are interlinked and interconnected aspirations.3 And yet, as we reach the halfway mark to the SDGs, we see the latest report by 
the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showing that the impacts of 
climate change on agriculture has led to devastating consequences on food 
production and food security.  
 Furthermore, t he recent report on The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the 
World by the FAO, the WHO and others, has shown that by 2030 the progr ess 
made in alleviating world hunger since 2015 will be nullified unless something 
drastic is done.  
 
This is why we must hasten our efforts and remain steadfast in our commitments.  
 
To this end, Brunei Darussalam is committed to the climate ambition and i s moving 
towards net zero by 2050, through forest preservation as well as transition to clean 
energy to shape a low carbon and climate resilient future. With 72% of our total 
land area still covered by rainforests, and our greenhouse gas emissions only 
accounts for 0.017% that of global total.  
 
As one of the regional champions for conservation, environment and forest 
preservation, Brunei is also playing a leading role regionally by hosting the ASEAN 
Centre for Climate Change. This will function as an inter -governmental centre for 
climate change coordination and cooperation.  
 
It will also strengthen the region’s capabilities to prevent, mitigate, and manage climate -related disasters through established mechanisms and formulation of 
policies. We appreciate th e contributions thus far from our partners and friends in 
this initiative, and continue to welcome interested parties on board.  
 
 
Mr. President,  
 The UN is the foremost multilateral institution, and thus its Member States have a 
responsibility to adhere to the founding principles of this organisation, specifically 
respecting the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of all Members.4 The maintenance of international peace and security is of utmost importance and 
this is no different in Southeast Asia.  
 
Last year, our region’s peace and stability was affected , and ASEAN collectively 
agreed on a Five -Point Consensus to work gradually and constr uctively towards a 
peaceful solution and eventual return to normalcy in one of our fellow Member 
States, namely Myanmar. Unfortunately matters continue to require close attention, and as such, we appreciate the continued support and contributions of 
the Un ited Nations and others in ASEAN’s efforts.  
 
On a similar note, the current conflict in Europe has also brought about global concern leading Member States to unanimously adopt a resolution that ensures 
accountability of the Security Council.  
 
It is, however, disappointing that the same attention and regard has not been given 
to resolving other areas of conflict, particularly on the question of Palestine.  
 
We need to ensure the same amount of attention and consideration be given to 
conflicts wherever they are, particularly where territorial integrity and sovereignty 
has been violated.  
 
Therefore, the international community must remain resolute in their com mitment 
to safeguarding the two- state solution towards achieving an independent state of 
Palestine based on the pre -1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.  
 
 
Mr. President,  
 
In conclusion, let me say that as we continue to address the concerns of  the world 
in “pre” and “post” crises terms, it is clear what these watershed moments in our 
collective history are.  
 
It should not  deepen divisions among us.  
It should not  entrench us in our differences (and,)  
It should not  lead us to serve only ourselves .5 Therefore, we should, in these final years of the SDGs, come together and uphold 
the spirit of multilateralism that would transform us into a better and more resilient 
United Nations.  
 
Thank you.

77th Session  of the United  Nations  General  Assembly  
General  Debate  
Statement   
by  
Hon.  Ali Sabry,   
Minister  of Foreign  Affairs  & Head  of Delegation  
of 
The Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of Sri Lanka  
 
24th September  2022 
New York  
Check  against  delivery  
Mr. President,   
Mr. Secretary -General ,  
Excellencies,   
Ladies  & Gentlemen,  
 
I am honoured  to represent  Sri Lanka  at the 77th session  of the UNGA;  a 
session  which  after two years  brings  together  world  leaders  post pandemic  
to an Assembly  in person.   
 
Permit  me the honor  of congratulating  His Excellency  Csaba  Kőrösi  on 
being  elected  President  of the current  session . Mr. President , Sri Lanka  
looks forward  to working  closely  with you and your team in the year ahead.   
 
May I also convey  our appreciation  to His Excellency  Abdulla  Shahid  of The 
Maldives  for his excellent  stewardship  of the 76th Session . As a close friend  
and neighbor  of the Maldives,  we express  particular  appreciation  for his 
Presidency  of Hope that gave us renewed  optimism  and vigour . Building  on 
this, we move  to the vision  of our new PGA of finding  solutions  through  
solidarity,  sustainability  and science . Mr. President,  
 
Seventy  seven years ago, when  the battlefield  of the Second  World  War 
was silent but its horrors  revaberated  around  the globe,  a new world  order 
emerged  out of the remains  of the older one. And that new world  order 
was manifested  by the Charter  of the United  Nations,  developed  by 50 
nations  at the San Franc isco Conference.  The United  Nations  is a table 
where  every  State can sit down,  a forum  where  everyone  can be heard  and 
where  everyone  is equally  important.  This is the concept  of multilateralism,  
and this is a fundamental  political  principle  of diplomacy.  It is said that 
multilateral  diplomacy  is similar  to gardening;  you plant,  you wait, you sow 
the seeds,  you wait, you trim and harvest  at some  point.  In multilateralism,  
we talk to each other,  we develop  a relationship  of trust and confidence  
and if something  was to come  up, you have the base to work from.   
 
Excellencies,   
 
The world  is facing  a multiplicity  of complex  interlocking  challenges.  The 
far-reaching  effects  of the pandemic  have been further exacerbated  by the 
current  global  crises. These  vulnerabilities  have been aggravated  by the 
devastating  consequences  of what the Secretary -General  has referred  to as 
the “five-alarm  global  fire” which  has resulted  inter-alia in “the triple 
planetary  crisis of climate  change,  biodiversity  loss and rising  pollution”.  
We are in addition  witnessing  extreme  weather  patterns resulting  in loss of 
life, property  and habitat,  involuntary  human  displacement,  and an 
accompanying  food and energy  crisis.  
It is not difficult  to imagine  that these  trends  lead to deepening  
inequalities,  both within  and between  States.  Developing  countries  and 
their economies  are at extreme  risk with Governments  facing  debt-default  
and financial  collapse  due to lack of access  to adequate  capital,  while 
people  face rising  poverty,  unemployment  and hunger.  As a consequence , 
nutrition  levels  especially  among  children  are being  affected  and their 
education  and intellectual  advancement  disrupted . Despite  our best efforts,  
our collective  ability  to realize  the Sustainable  Development  Goals  or even 
to sustain  the gains already  achieved  is becoming  increasingl y difficult . 
 
Mr. President,   
 
It is against  this challenging  global  backdrop , that significant  changes  have 
taken  place in Sri Lanka  since the last UNGA . The external  and internal  
challenges  we face provide  an opportunity  for implementing  political , social  
and economic  reforms  that will lead to recovery  and prosperity  for our 
people.  Sri Lanka  believes  that this is the moment  to realise  our collective  
vision  for the future;  an opportunity  to build a more just, sustainable  and 
prosperous  future  for all Sri Lankans,  ‘to build back better’.  We look 
forward  to the cooperation  and support  of the international  community  
including  the United  Nations,  as we embark  on this journey.  
Following  prolonged  social  unrest  and protests  in the country,  President  
Ranil Wickremesinghe,  in his maiden  speech  in Parliament  last month  
stated,  I quote,  “I will implement  social  and political  reforms  requested  by 
the nation”,  unquote.  These  measures  include  a review  of the present  
procedures , the strengthening  of the institutional  framework  of democratic  
governance  and adopt ion of urgent  measure s to restore  long term 
economic  stability.  We have understood  that this will only be possible  if we 
engage  in a strict adherence  to fiscal discipline  and far reaching  economic  
& institutional  reforms.   
 
Mr. President,  we are committed  to that process.   
 
It is envisaged  that through  the proposed  legislative  and constitutional  
amendments , democratic  governance  will be reinforced  with independent  
oversight  institutions  as well as with enhanced  public  scrutiny.  Legal and 
administrative  frameworks  are being  strengthened  to ensure  transparency,  
integrity , accountability  and inclusivity  in providing access  to justice.  A 
greater  participation  of women  and youth  will be ensured  in this process.  
Mr. President , 
 
We remain  cognizant  of and acutely  sensitive  to the events  that have taken  
place in the recent  past. The Government  is extremely  sensitive  to the 
socio-economic  hardships  faced  by our people.  We are pleased  to have 
reached  a staff level understanding  with the IMF. We have put in place 
measures  to protect  the vulnerable  segments  of society  and will endeavor  
to ensure  that these economic  reforms  will have a minimum  impact  on 
their lives. Our institutions  and society  have demonstrated  remarkable  
resilience  in the face of very difficult  circumstances.    
 
We unconditionally  recognize  the fact that one has a fundamental  right to 
the freedom  of expression,  which  we all treat as being  sacrosanct.  
However,  it must also be appreciated  that, this freedom  must be within  the 
constitutional  order,  and must be exercised  having  regard  to one’s 
fundamental  duty to express  oneself  within  the confines  of the law. Mr. President,   
 
I am pleased  to inform  this august  assembly  that Sri Lanka’s  nationwide  
strategy  in containing  the human  health  impact  of COVID -19 has been 
largely  successful  as a result  of proact ive and non-discriminatory  measures  
by the government , and the effective  delivery  capabilities  of our strong 
health  care infrastructure.  Our vaccination  drive exceeded  WHO targets. 
However,  as a developing  country  we were highly  vulnerable  to the 
economic  fallout  of the pandemic.  The virus has opened  a window  to the 
future  which  we must exploit , highlight ing the importance  of multilateral  
cooperation  through  global  health  networks .  
 
Mr. President,   
 
Permit  me to briefly  turn to the aspect  of climate  change.  As a climate  
vulnerable  country,  climate  change  has had the potential  to adversely  
impact  Sri Lanka’s  socio-economic  progress  as well as food security  and 
livelihoods . Sri Lanka  has pledged  to meet the targets  of the Paris 
Agreement  and our updated  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  (NDC)  
submitted  to the UNFCCC  last year with the aim of reducing  emissions  to 
achieve  carbon  neutrality  by 2050.  We firmly  believe  that these  
commitments  should  not adversely  impact  the green  economic  
development  objectives.  We also appreciate  that meeting  the NDC targets  
and executing  the corresponding  energy  transition  towards  renewable  and 
sustainable  energy  and energy  efficiency  measures will require  significant  
climate  financing .  
Mr. President , 
 
You will appreciate  that we cannot  do this alone.  We believe  that in 
tandem  with our own efforts,  the world’s  largest  emitters  of greenhouse  
gases  must fulfill their commitments  and assist  developing  nations  in 
adaptation  and mitigation  measures  under  a common  but differentiated  
framework.  We need to work towards  a just, sustainable , resilient  and 
inclusive  recovery  from the adverse  impacts  of climate  change,  and the 
energy  transition.   
 
Turning  to the ocean , Mr. President,  you will appreciate  that as an island  
nation,  we are acutely  concerned  about  and sensitive  to the impact  of 
pollution  and climate  change  on oceans.  With rapid pressure  on land 
resources,  the world  is turning  towards  the oceans  for sustenance  – not 
only for food security  but also as a source  of raw materials  for industries  
and energy.  We are committed  to the sustainable  use of the ocean s and its 
resources  in consonance  with SDG 14.  At the UNGA , in May this year, we 
were pleased  to have led a small but significant  Nature-based  Solution  to 
mitigate  the impact  of climate  change,  that led to the UN declaring  1st 
March as World  Seagrass  Day. Seagrasses  are an important  carbon  sink 
and absorb  significantly  more carbon  than tropical  rain forests. Mr. President,   
 
There  is a likelihood  that the world  will not reach the scheduled  milestones  
to achieve  ‘Zero Hunger’ by 2030.  It is predicted  that food and nutrition  
security  will be at great risk. Sri Lanka  is paying  serious  heed to these  
warning  signs.  Sri Lanka  support s sustainable  transformation  of agriculture  
to a modernized  sector  and encourages  enhanced  food production  to 
ensure  food security.  Sri Lanka  has initiated  the national  food security  
programme  with the dual objectives  of ensuring  that no citizen  should  
suffer for the want of food and no child should  be a victim  of malnutrition.  
 
Adequate  nutrition  is a sine qua non and vital to ensure  that children  of all 
socio-economic  backgrounds  can enjoy  good health.  The provision  of 
quality  education  and health  care for all, is at the core of Sri Lanka’s  social  
protection  policies  and provided  the foundation  upon which  Sri Lanka  was 
able to mitigate  the effects  of the ‘global  learning  crisis’  during  the COVID -
19 pandemic.  Rapid  conversions  to digital  systems  of delivery  of education  
threatened  universa l access,  participation  and survival  in the education  
system  especially  in children  of low-income  households.  Sri Lanka  aims to 
bridge  the digital  divide , and ensure  that no child will be left behind . Mr. President,  
 
Despite  severe  challenges,  we will endeavor  to maintain  the significant  
progress  we have made  towards  achieving  the 2030 Agenda  on Sustainable  
Development.  Our efforts  have placed  us in a leading  position  in the Asia-
Pacific  region  for SDG data availabilit y, thus enhancing  Sri Lanka’s  capacity  
for evidence  informed  policy  making  for SDGs in future.  We recognize  that 
investment  in human  capital  is an indispensable  essential  for the future  of 
our country.  It is no surprise , Mr. President  that Sri Lanka  is ranked  in the 
high Human  Development  category,  occupying  rank 73 out of 191 
countries  globally,  and is the highest  in the region.   
 
Having  said that, we are nonetheless  concerned  that current  challenges  
have disrupted  progress.  The UN Secretary -General  has in a serious  
warning  made  reference  to “rescuing  the Sustainable  Development  Goals” . 
This warning  is followed  by an observation  by the UNDP , that for the first 
time in 32 years,  the Human  Development  Index  has declined  globall y for 
two years  consecutively .  
Mr. President ,  
  
Let me say a word about  global  security.  Geopolitical  tensions  among  
nations  have heightened  creating  insecurity  and polarization  among  States.  
Agreed  frameworks  for arms control,  nonproliferati on and disarmament  
have become  fragile.  At the 10th Review  Conference  of the NPT concluded  
recently , which  remains  the centerpiece  of the global  nuclear  disarmament  
and non-proliferation  regime,  we were regrettably  unable  to arrive  once 
again  at a consensus  outcome.   
 
While  we address  contemporary  challenges,  we must not forget  the 
lingering  issue of Palestine.  While  restating  Sri Lanka’s  consistent  and 
principled  position  that the Palestinian  people  have a legitimate  and 
inalienable  right to the natural  resources  in their territory  and to statehood,  
we further  recognize  the legitimate  security  concerns  of both the 
Palestinian  and Israeli  people , and an urgent  resolution  of the matter  on 
the basis of the UN Resolution  on the attainment  of the two-state solution . Mr. President,  
 
The absence  of a regulatory  supervisory  regime  concerning  the use of new 
technologies  in cyberspace  and in Artificial  Intelligence  needs  to be 
addressed  urgently.  Their ability  to cause  large-scale disruption , 
disinformation  and undermine  scientifically  established  findings  is of real 
concern;  a danger  we all face. Sri Lanka,  which is implementing  the 
nation’s  first Information  and Cyber  Security  Strategy,  has identified  the 
importance  of establishing  a partnership -based  approach  to protect  cyber  
space  in order to confront  multinational  cyber  threats.  
 
Mr. President , 
  
I must make  a brief reference  to the scourge  of terrorism.  Sri Lanka  was a 
victim  of terrorism  for several  decades.  Terrorists’  choice  of targets,  
methods  of financing  and radicalization  as well as the use of new 
technologies  as weapons  has been constantly  evolving.  Legislative  
measures  and law enforcement  mechanisms  must be put in place to 
counter  radical  ideologies  leading  to violent  extremism  and to curb the 
terrorists’  use and abuse  of the internet  and social  media  platforms.  At the 
same time it is necess ary to develop  the critical  thinking  capacity  of youth,  
strengthen  community  bonds,  foster  a sense  of civic responsibility,  and 
build community  resilience  to mitigate  the effects  and influences  of violent  
extremist  ideology  leading  to terrorism. Mr. President,  
As our contribution  to maintaining  international  peace  and security,  Sri 
Lanka  looks forward  to enhancing  our participation  in UN Peacekeeping  
Operations  with professional  men and women  to serve  as UN 
Peacekeepers.  I take this opportunity  to honor the thousands  of men and 
women  who, for decades,  have helped  countries  navigate  the difficult  path 
from conflict  to peace  under  the Blue Helmet.  We have taken  many  
measures  to ensure  that Sri Lankan  Peacekeepers  with a wealth  of 
experience  in counter -terrorism  and counter  insurgency  operations,  are 
trained  and equipped  with theoretical  and practical  knowledge  of all 
necessary  functions  of peacekeeping,  including  the promotion  and 
protection  of human  rights.   
 
Mr. President,  
 
It is indeed  a watershed  mome nt for the international  community:  a 
moment  of great challenge  and opportunity.  The complex  and 
interconnected  crises  that we face cannot  be resolved  by nations  acting  on 
their own.  It is an opportunity  to demonstrate  global  solidarity , diplomacy  
and collective  efforts,  leveraging  the ideas and talents  of all of our people  
and all segments  of our society  to find transformative  solutions  which  leave 
no one behind.  Multilateralism,  Mr. President,  is a tool for diplomacy  that 
rises above  such challenges.  Conflicts,  disaste rs and crises  will not stop at 
passport  control.  Multilateralism  is not without  its shortcomings , and 
undoubtedly  it provides  a solid framework  for resolving  contemporary  
challenges.  
Mr. President,   
 
This, I would say, is the mission  of this august  Assembly,  and perhaps  the 
singular  reason  for which  it was established  77 years ago. And that 
perhaps  is the reason,  why Sri Lanka  and many  others  applied  to be 
members,  to participate,  to be visible,  to be heard,  to embellish  this 
organization  with our own flavors,  perspectives,  history,  and knowledge  to 
this fine amalgam  and grow from the common  work discussions  and 
disputes  that we join issue with.   
 
I might  wind up by citing  the observations  of one of our late Prime  
Ministers,  who committed  Sri Lanka  to the way of a socialist  democracy,  to 
non-alignment  and to an independent  foreign  policy,  based  on friendship  
with all countries,  irrespective  of differing  ideological  and social  systems,  
when  he said ‘we have to build up a new society for ourselves;  one as I 
have said, which  best suits the genius  of our country.  We should like to get 
some  ideas and principles  from this side, and some  from the other,  until a 
coherent  form of society  is made  up that suits our people,  in the context  of 
a changing  world  today.  That is why we do not range  ourselves  on the side 
of this power  bloc or that.’  
Mr. President,   
 
Permit  me to make  the observation  that, the 193 nations  represented  here 
jointly  share  the responsibility  to establish  justice,  to maintain  peace  and 
ensure  progress  in a world  that is in trouble  as never  before.  We have a 
Charter  and a formidable  body of international  law inclusive  of our supreme  
law of the Constitution  of the Republic  and other local statutes.  We are 
acutely  consci ous of the fact that notwithstanding  all these  sophistication s, 
multipronged  challenges  remain . The Government  of Sri Lanka  is 
committed  to overcoming  these  challenges.    
 
It is to that commitment  that Sri Lanka  pledges  today,  in the sincere  hope 
that we will exploit  the crisis that is at hand,  build back better,  leaving  no 
one behind  and rise to new horizons  of freedom  and progress.    
 
I thank  you.", LKA,2022
 UZB_77_2022,"The Seventy -Seventh Session  
of the United Nations General Assembly  
General Debate  Statement by H.E.  Mr. Vladimir Norov,  
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan  
(New York, September 24, 2022)  
 
 
Mr. President!  
Dear Secretary General!  
Distinguished Heads of Delegations!  
Ladies and Gentlemen!  
 
I congratulate His Excellency Mr.  Csaba Kőrösi on his election  
as the President of the Seventy Seventh Session of the United Nations 
General Assembly.  
I also take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Mr.  Abdullah 
Shahid for the successful leadership during the Seventy Sixth Session.  
The world today is facing a deep crisis of trust at the global level, an 
intensification of numerous challenges to stab ility and security, growth 
of geopolitical confrontation , and an increase of risks of bloc mentality.  
The expansion and aggravation of armed conflicts in various parts 
of the world are destabilizing  international trade  and economic ties that 
have not yet r ecovered from the consequences of the pandemic. The 
challenges of ensuring food and energy security are aggravated . 
The g lobal climate shocks, the growing shortage of natural and 
water resources, the spread of infectious diseases - all contribute to the 
aggravation of conflicts and the emergence of humanitarian crises,  
as well as threaten the foundations of life.  
Clearly, no country can avoid global risks and challenges or tackle 
them alone. Constructive dialogue and multilateral cooperation based on 
consid eration and respect for the interests of all countries are the only 
way out of the dangerous spiral of crises. Effective international 
cooperation is essential if the world is to become more stable, 
predictable , and prosperous.  
Under  the current conditions , we strongly believe it is important  
to strengthen the central role of the United Nations in addressing global 
and regional challenges. The UN should evolve for  
it to respond effectively to the transformations taking place. 
The e stablishment of intercivi lizational and intercultural relations 
and dialogue is also extremely important in finding the coherent  
approaches and solutions, relieving global tension, uncertainty and 
unpredictability. With this in mind, at the Shanghai Cooperation 
Organization Summit  in Samarkand on September  16 the President of 
the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev put forward the 
Samarkand Solidarity Initiative for Common Security and Prosperity . 
Its goal is to contribute to the restoration of mutual trust and 
stability in international relations, as well as to strengthen solidarity 
through the establishment of a broad dialogue free from geopolitical 
rivalry, ideological contradictions , and dispute s. 
We propose to jointly exchange views on  the practical 
implementation of this initiative at the Samarkand Forum in 2023 with 
the participation of UN representatives, political leaders, public, business  
community,  and academi a. 
 
Dear friends!  
 
This year, we adopted the Development Strategy for New 
Uzbekistan for 2022 -2026, aimed at deepening the democratic 
processes, ensuring the rule of law, and improving the l iving standards of 
people . 
This Strategy is based on the outcomes of the reforms carr ied out in 
our country over the previous five years and is designed to advance 
comprehensive implement ation of  the Sustainable Development Goals.  
In particular, by 2030 we intend to halve the level of poverty, 
increase the effectiveness of the social prote ction system to respond  all 
those in need, strengthen food security, and become one of the world ’s 
upper middle -income countries.  
Currently, Uzbekistan is on the eve of an important political event – 
a Constitutional Reform.  
The key goal of updating the Constitution is to ensure  sustainab ility 
and irreversib ility of the process of fundamental transformation of the 
state system and public administration that shall respect  and protect the 
honor and dignity of a person, guarantee his inviolable  rights and 
freedoms.  
The idea “For human honor and dignity” shall be deeply enshrined 
in the Constitution. The norms on the complete abolition of the death 
penalty, Miranda Rule and Habeas Corpus, as well as the environmental 
human rights shall  be introdu ced to the Constitution. 
The Constitutional amendments should become directly applicable  
aimed at guaranteeing and protecting the interests of people of all 
backgrounds.  In particular, the prohibition of the use of forced labor and 
other worst forms of chi ld labor, or the employment refusal for pregnant 
women or women with children  will be guaranteed on constitutional 
level.  
Furthermore, it is also proposed to introduce the norms that ensure 
openness, tran sparency, and accountability of s tate agencies.  
The amendments to the Constitution were reviewed by public  and 
will be put to a referendum.  
 
 
Ladies and gentlemen!  
 
We fully endorse the initiative of Secretary General António 
Guterres to hold a “Summit of the Future” in September 2023.  
Uzbekistan highly appreciates the successful outcomes  of the 
historic Transforming Education Summit, which has demonstrated the 
commitment of the international community to join efforts for the 
speedy restoration and modernization of education systems by 
increasing funding and innovation.  
Uzbekistan has already achieved tangible  results in this area. Over 
the past 5 years, enrollment in higher education has increased from 9% 
to 29%, and children with preschool education – from 27% to 67.2%.  
It is the youth that should play a key role in the processes that are 
directly related to their fate and future. To this end, Uzbekistan plans to 
convene  the first meeting of the Youth Council of the countries of Central 
and South Asia in 2023, which will become a platfor m for new ideas and 
specific initiative s. We count on the support of the UN in holding this 
important forum.  
On November 14-16, 2022, jointly with the UNESCO, we will host 
the World Conference on Early Childhood Care and Education in 
Tashkent. The Forum wi ll facilitate the exchange of best practices to 
ensure universal, equitable , and quality education.  
We invite Ministers of Education from your countries to participate 
at this High -Level Forum. 
Dear participants!  
 
Today, thanks to the joint efforts of the Central Asian States,  
a fundamentally new political atmosphere has been created in our 
region.  
Launched at the initiative of Uzbekistan, the mechanism of 
Consultative Meetings of the Heads of State of the region has become a 
vivid symbol of a new era o f regional cooperation.  
At the last Consultative Meeting, held on July 21 , 2022, a truly 
historic Treaty of Friendship, Good Neighborliness and Cooperation for 
the Development of Central Asia in the 21st century was agreed upon.  
The international recognition of the deepening partnership of the 
countries of the region is reflected in  a number of resolutions adopt ed by 
the UN General Assembly in support of strengthening peace, stability , 
and regional cooperation in Central Asia.  
We rely on further su pport from the international community for 
the processes of rapprochement and cooperation between the countries 
of Central Asia,  and integration of the region into global economic and 
transport ties.  
We express our gratitude to Secretary General António Gu terres for 
supporting our initiative to hold an International Conference on the 
Implementation of the UN Global Counter -Terrorism Strategy in Central 
Asia, which took place in March 2022 in Tashkent.  
Taking into account the outcomes of the Forum, we propos e to 
establish the UN Counter -Terrorism Regional Office in Central Asia in 
order to successfully implement the Global Strategy and continuously 
monitor the implementation of the updated Joint Action Plan.  
 
Mr. President!  
 
The p rospects for the development of Central Asia are inextricably 
linked with ensuring peace in neighboring Afghanistan.  
We are concerned about the decline in international attention to 
this country, which is experiencing a deep humanitarian crisis. We 
consider it extremely important to p revent the isolation of Afghanistan, 
leaving it alone with the existing problems. This will undoubtedly have 
negative consequences for regional and international security. 
The International Conference on Afghanistan held in July in 
Tashkent with the part icipation of the delegation of the interim 
government showed the interest of the world community in the 
development of coordinated approaches towards this country.  
We are convinced that the general priority of the international 
community should be the rest oration of the Afghan economy, its 
integration into interregional economic processes, the implementation of 
infrastructure and socially significant projects. To solve these problems, 
the support of the UN, international financial institutions , and donor 
countries is needed.  
Uzbekistan is making a feasible contribution to the international 
efforts to assist Afghanistan. Uzbekistan has established the 
International Transport and Logistics Hub in the border city of Termez, 
which is actively used by UN agencies  to provide humanitarian 
assistance to this country.  
We propose to create  a special Humanitarian Support Fund for 
Afghanistan in Termez and send  its financial resources to overcome the 
social crisis, implement educational programs for the youth as well as 
healthcare projects.  
The UN General Assembly Resolution on “Strengthening 
connectivity between Central and South Asia” adopted in July 2022, at 
the initiative of Uzbekistan prioritizes the involvement of Afghanistan in 
economic cooperation, and its transformation into a bridge connecting 
the two regions.  
The practical implementation of these ideas will be facilitated by the 
implementation of trans -regional infrastructure projects, such as the 
construction of  the Termez -Mazar -i-Sharif -Kabul -Peshawar r ailway.  
The solution to the problems of involving Afghanistan in the 
regional trade and economic ties will be facilitated by the proposed 
establishment by Uzbekistan with the support of the UN of the 
Interregional Center for Connectivity in Tashkent  
 
 
Dear  participants!  
 
Today, the negative consequences of climate change are acutely 
manifested in our region.  
We stand ready to actively participate in the multilateral efforts to 
promote the topical issues of the green agenda and curb climate change 
processes. 
Uzbekistan has taken on an additional obligation to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement and is 
implementing a comprehensive strategy for the transition to a green 
economy and the development of renewable energy.  
In 2021 President of Uzbekistan launched a massive initiative called 
“Yashil Makon ” (Green Land ) on planting 1 billion trees and shrubs 
across the country over the next five years.  
The Aral Sea is the biggest environmental cris is in our region. Over 
the past 5 years, 1.7 million hectares of forest plantations have been 
planted on the drained seabed.  
I take this opportunity to thank the General Assembly for adopting 
the Resolution on “Declaring the Aral Sea region a zone of ecological 
innovations and technologies”.  
This year we plan to host the First Aral Sea International Forum 
under the UN auspices in Nukus.  
In 2023, for the first time, we will host the 14th Conference of the 
Parties to the UN Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species 
of Wild Animals, as well as a meeting of the Committee to Review the 
Implementation of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification in 
Uzbekistan.  
We invite the Member States and the UN agencies to take part at 
these events at high -level.  
 
Mr. President!  
 
This year we celebrat e the 30th Anniversary of Uzbekistan ’s 
membership in the United Nations, which is the only universal structure 
for maintaining international peace and security.  
We reaffirm Uzbekistan ’s commitment to the UN Charter and 
express readiness to deepen multiface ted cooperation with the United 
Nations.  
 
Thank you for your attention!", UZB,2022

DURING THE GENERAL DEBATE  
 OF THE

UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
General Assembly Hall  
United Nations Headquarters  
 
24 September  2022 
 Mr. President,  
 
Trinidad and Tobago congratulates you on your Presidency of the 77th Session, and we 
commit to you our full support.  
 
I also express gratitude to your predecessor, whose leadership and dedication demonstrated 
that to be a great leader y ou don’t have to come from a large country.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
In our maiden statement to the General Assembly, as a newly independent nation in 1962, 
our first Permanent Representative, the late Sir Ellis Clarke declared that Trinidad and 
Tobago embraces th e solemn responsibility that comes with membership of this 
Organisation.  
 
I stand before you today, in our 60th year of Independence, on the exact anniversary 
of the day on which we became a Republic, to reaffirm Trinidad and Tobago’s 
unequivocal acceptan ce of our obligation to honour the responsibility of membership.  
 
Over the decades, Trinidad and Tobago has anchored its multilateral engagement on the 
founding purposes and principles of the United Nations. We have nurtured these principles 
by maintaining  a strong tradition of democratic governance which respects constitutionally 
enshrined fundamental human rights and freedoms, and promotes strict adherence to the 
rule of law.  
 
Trinidad and Tobago accordingly is bound by duty to uphold these principles 
unconditionally and to defend them, whenever there is evidence of breach.  
  
This is why Trinidad and Tobago cannot accept or ignore any unilateral attempt to violate 
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of any State. The violation of Ukraine’s 
internatio nally agreed borders constitutes a flagrant violation of the UN Charter and of 
international law. It is a clear threat to international peace and security, and the only 
credible solution is to end this aggression immediately.  
 
Therefore, we call on the Rus sian Federation to immediately abandon its action and to 
resume negotiations with the Ukrainians in good faith, to find a peaceful and durable 
resolution. 
 Mr. President,  
 
Our collective experience over the last seven months has laid bare the urgent necess ity for 
the Security Council to be reformed to reflect current geopolitical realities.  
 
And as the international community celebrates the 20th Anniversary of the entry into force 
of the Rome Statute, which established the International Criminal Court, eve nts around the 
world confirm that if in fact the Court did not exist, it would have to be created in order to 
ensure accountability for growing acts of impunity.  
 
Trinidad and Tobago is proud of our longstanding involvement with this Court, through 
the pi oneering work of our distinguished former Prime Minister and President, from the 
little island of Tobago, the late Arthur N.R. Robinson. The mission of the International 
Criminal Court and its record as an independent tribunal, engenders the fullest suppor t of 
Trinidad and Tobago.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
As the war in Ukraine rages, fuels such as coal are having quite a resurgence and the 
commitments made in Glasgow are at risk of being severely derailed. At the same time, 
climate finance commitments made by dev eloped countries are definitely not on track.  
 
Droughts, wildfires, floods, and cataclysmic hurricanes and typhoons are realities that 
small island states know all too well. At the same time, slow -onset events such as the 
deterioration of coral reefs and the influx of sargassum seaweed, threaten our fragile 
ecosystems and the livelihoods of our people, especially our fisherfolk and those dependent 
on tourism.   
Accordingly, Trinidad and Tobago calls for the full and effective implementation of the 
Paris Agr eement. A dedicated facility to address loss and damage under the UNFCCC 
Financial Mechanism is an absolute necessity. These actions must be prioritized because 
what is at stake is the very existence and viability of small island States.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
The added burden of rampant global inflation and the crises of food, fuel, feed and 
fertilisers have placed extraordinary strain on our economies and our people, further 
imperilling our ability to achieve sustainable development across the globe. 
 On the cr itical issue of achieving food security for all people, the international community 
must work together to accelerate global food production. On this issue, CARICOM Leaders 
have not just been calling for action but have been acting in solidarity and with 
decisiveness. In August, Trinidad and Tobago was pleased to host the Second CARICOM 
Agri-Investment Forum and Expo, as part of our region’s commitment to reduce its food 
import bill by 25 percent by 2025.  
 
Mr President,  
 
Trinidad and Tobago is firmly commit ted to working with CARICOM and other partners 
towards the restoration of peace and stable democratic governance in Haiti. Our objective 
must be to work with the Haitians, to secure their long -term progress and future.  
  
We therefore urge the United Nation s system and the international donor community to 
urgently strengthen their role and engagement with Haiti. We encourage them to provide 
the necessary assistance to quell the ongoing and devastating gang violence and to urgently 
improve the humanitarian si tuation in that country.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
In the Caribbean, our efforts to build safe and peaceful societies are being completely 
undermined by transnational organised crime, human trafficking, the illicit trade of drugs, 
and a steady flow of illegal fire arms from source countries beyond our region; all 
contributing to unacceptably high levels of gang violence within our communities. We are 
committed to further strengthening our cooperation with regional and international partners 
to address these challeng es, which threaten the very stability of our societies.  
 
Violent extremism, international terrorism, and the use of technology for criminal 
purposes, remain clear and present dangers. In combatting these phenomena, Trinidad and 
Tobago attaches the highest  value to collaborating with the United Nations and other 
international partners. We must bear in mind, that in addressing extremism, there must be 
no compromise to the constitutionally protected rights and freedoms of our citizens.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
In all of these complexities, we must recognise the critically important role of women as 
agents of positive change, and to that end, Trinidad and Tobago will once again table the 
 biennial resolution on “Women, Disarmament, Non -proliferation and Arms Control”. We 
encourage all Member States to co -sponsor and support this forward -looking resolution.  
 
But Mr. President, while we assiduously work to encourage and ensure the inclusion of 
women in places and spaces of decision -making, we must continue to insist that the rights 
of women and girls are fully respected and protected, at all levels of society. Violence 
against women and girls continues to be a menace, destroying lives, and impeding overall 
progress toward balanced and inclusive sustainable development. Add ressing this must be 
a priority, and in Trinidad and Tobago, a growing number of stakeholders, including the 
private sector, have now joined the national effort to make our society safe for women and 
girls.  
 
Mr. President,  
The last two years, in particula r, have demonstrated, that the structure of the international 
economic and financial system is not fit for purpose. The system, as designed, actually 
undermines developing countries in their pursuit of sustainable development.  
 
It cannot be business as usu al. A transformative global agenda, such as the 2030 Agenda, 
necessitates a transformative economic and financial framework that is compatible with 
the achievement of the SDGs. Without such a shift in the global architecture, even the best 
efforts at the n ational level will not produce the results that we need in the Global South.  
  
Trinidad and Tobago calls on the international community, to adopt tailored measures and 
solutions to address the fundamental financing challenges that developing countries face , 
with particular attention to LDCs and SIDS.  
 
One such measure is the adoption of a multidimensional vulnerability index, which 
we consider to be an utmost priority.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
Our history cannot be erased or rewritten. We therefore continue to ca ll for reparatory 
justice for the unpaid debt for centuries of enslavement of African people, for the historical 
crimes of native genocide visited upon the indigenous peoples of this world, and for the 
exploitative legacy of colonialism that has directly r esulted in the persistent under -
development of Caribbean nations and so many others. 
 We continue to call for the abandonment and destruction of all nuclear weapons as the only 
means of guaranteeing the avoidance of total annihilation of humankind.  
 
We con tinue to call for the unconditional lifting of the unjust economic, commercial and 
financial embargo imposed on the people of Cuba, and for the full integration of Cuba into 
the international economic and political system.  
 
We also continue to call for a l ong-lasting and mutually agreed, two -state solution to the 
Israel -Palestine conflict, which would guarantee the Palestinians a permanent homeland 
and recognise Israel’s right to exist in peace and security.  
 
Mr. President,  
To get the 2030 Agenda back on tr ack, all stakeholders, whether big or small, powerful or 
otherwise, must embrace the value of multilateralism. Clearly, we are not quite there yet.   
In this regard, I echo the words of one of Trinidad and Tobago’s greatest calypsonians, 
David Rudder, who in his iconic song “Rally Round the West Indies” said “soon we must 
take a side or be lost in the rubble, in a divided world that don’t need islands no more, 
are we doomed forever to be at somebody’s mercy? Little keys can open up mighty 
doors.”  
 
Mr. Presi dent,  
   
This world needs the little islands.  
 
We bring a unique perspective that is valuable and beneficial and necessary. Trinidad and 
Tobago continues to offer the point of view of a small, sovereign, democratic nation, 
harbouring a big ambition; namel y to unleash the creativity and resourcefulness of our 
diverse people, especially our youth, to make the most positive contribution to community, 
to society, and to the world.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
As a relatively young nation, Trinidad and Tobago’s people ar e our greatest source of 
power and energy. You can feel it in the rhythm of our tassa drums and in the melodies of 
our national instrument, the steel -pan.  
 
Our achievements stand in testimony of what can be achieved when a small nation punches 
 above its w eight class. Our citizens have served as Judges on the ICC, and with respect to 
the Law of the Sea, we have given the world, experts of the calibre of Lennox Ballah and 
Anthony Lucky.  
 
We have contributed extensively to the work of the United Nations, ser ving on the Security 
Council, the Economic and Social Council, and a range of subsidiary bodies and organs.  
  
Mr. President,   
 
Trinidad and Tobago looks forward, with enthusiasm and optimism, to our next sixty years 
of membership of the United Nations. We continue to deepen engagement and partnership 
with our neighbours in the Caribbean and with all members of the international community 
to achieve our common objectives and thus, to strengthen international peace and security.  
 
As we write the next chapter  in our nation’s history, I can share with you that Trinidad and 
Tobago offers itself to serve as President of the General Assembly during the 78th Session. 
Being tasked with such a defining role by the Assembly would truly be an honour and a 
responsibilit y that the Government and people of Trinidad and Tobago shall embrace with 
commitment and impartiality.  
 
In the best traditions of multilateralism, let us therefore join our strengths for the benefit 
and upliftment of all of humankind. Let us build a truly  global community, where no one 
is left behind.  
 
In closing, Mr. President,  I offer this General Assembly the inspiration found in the words 
of the national motto of Trinidad and Tobago, which declares , “Together we aspire, 
Together we achieve.”

 77th United Nations General Assembly, New York  
 
 
Madam/ Mr. President of the General Assembly,  
Distinguished Delegates  
Ladies and Gentlemen  
 
[I would like to start by congratulating Mr. Csaba Kőrösi on his election as the 
president of the 77th session of the General Assembly.]  
I would also like to thank the Secretary General, Mr. Antonio Guterres fo r his 
leadership, as well as those whose daily work is dedicated to the ideals of the United 
Nations.  
Mr/Madam  President.  
We meet in critical times.  
This hall, the venue for so many historic events, is in and of itself a testament to some 
of the ideas that  this organization, one of the most important in world history, is built 
on.  
In this hall, during this session, we are equal.  
Whether we represent a global superpower or one of the more than 70 member states, 
like mine, that have less than one million inh abitants - in this room we all have theCHECK AGAINST DELIVERY // EMBARGO TIL DELIVERY  
 
 
2 
 same number of seats at the table, we each have a vote and we all have a voice and 
the right to let it be heard from this podium.  
And at the hand of the president of the General Assembly, there is a gavel - a simple 
wooden hammer, an instrument so light and non -threatening that it could hardly be 
of any use as a weapon to hurt. Nevertheless, the person who holds it can take control 
of the deliberations of the most powerful men and women in the world. The striking 
of this small hammer against a simple block of wood compels respect for the rules 
that the members of these United Nations have agreed to abide by in this chamber.  
It is a symbol of order.  
And it is therefore fitting that the inscription on the gavel says „Með  lögum skal land 
byggja“ - it is in Icelandic, as the gavel is an article that Iceland donated to this great 
organization. It means that society shall be built on the pillars of law - it is a quote 
from an ancient Icelandic text of law - and the next line e laborates with the statement 
that the land will indeed be desolated if lawlessness or unjust law are allowed to take 
hold. In the global context, we are all acutely aware, not least the smaller states of 
this world, that a world not governed by rules, will  be a world dominated by force.  
*** 
Mr/Madam  President.  
We meet at a time when a powerful country, a permanent member of the United 
Nations Security Council, has decided to challenge the norms and international laws 
that have served the world so well since world leaders, with the horrors of two world 
wars vivid in their memory, decided ""to save succeeding generations from the 
scourge of war, and the untold sorrow that it brings to mankind.""CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY // EMBARGO TIL DELIVERY

 The post -world war order has not prevented problems and confli cts from arising. 
Mistakes, and questionable decisions have been made. The sorrows and horrors of 
war and conflict have indeed been a part of too many lives in too many parts of the 
world. But, by and large, wars of territorial expansion have simply not be en allowed.  
In my part of the world, my generation does not hold memories of the horrors of a 
global war. We have grown up believing that peace among nations can almost be 
taken for granted.  
It cannot.  
However, the global system has provided an answer to  the critical questions of how 
problems are solved.  
This construct is now under threat.  
It is our duty as leaders, not least those of us who are young, to make sure that the 
fortunes of the past decades do not lead us into dangerous complacency. We must 
advocate for the multilateral system at every opportunity and convince the peoples 
of the world, that despite its flaws, it is vastly and completely superior to any other 
method of resolving issues and disputes between states.  
Of cours e, we must continue to reform our organization and make it more fit for 
purpose and more representative to meet growing and more complicated new 
challenges. Iceland fully supports the vision of the Secretary General put forward in 
Our Common Agenda, on how  we can revitalize our work and strengthen the 
multilateral system so it can best serve future generations.

 The unlawful and brutal full -scale invasion of Russia into Ukraine came as a shock, 
a rude awakening to how the world might look if the ability to destroy, rather than 
the capacity to create, is allowed to determine the fate of nations. The absolute and 
sickening brutality that Russia has shown, as evidenced in newly liberated areas, is 
beyond comprehension. It represents an ab solute breakdown of civilization.  
Therefore, before I will say anything else about world affairs. I will say that for the 
sake of humanity, Ukraine must win. Russia’s aggression must be defeated, and the 
crimes perpetrated in its name must be accounted for  and punished. The irresponsible 
words of Russia’s president these past few days are a chilling reminder that giving 
in to bullies and rule -breakers will only encourage more bullying and further rule -
breaking.  
For the sake of humanity, this madness must st op.

Mr/Madam  President.  
The number of people who are faced with food insecurity, poverty and hunger  is 
increasing at a terrifying rate due to the lingering effects of the pandemic and the 
pandemic response, armed conflict, and climate change. Those facing acute food 
insecurity have soared to 345 million this year with no end in sight.   
Natural catastrophies  that are linked to climate change are becoming more 
relentless and severe, as evidenced for example by the recent flooding in Pakistan 
and the droughts in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel  
Iceland has been, and will continue to, increase its funding for humanitarian 
assistance, working primarily with UN entities. Iceland is committed to shoulder itsCHECK AGAINST DELIVERY // EMBARGO TIL DELIVERY

 responsibility, as demonstrated by our incr ease in humanitarian and development 
assistance.  
We face a climate crisis  that will not go away on its own. It is paramount that all 
countries  step up every effort to accelerate our fight towards better climate resilience.  
Iceland is committed to doing its  part and has set ambitious targets of achieving 
carbon neutrality and full energy conversion no later than 2040. We increased our 
contribution  to climate finance with a strong focus on balanced approached to 
mitigation and adaptation and are committed to do more.  
There is a crisis in public health  in many countries, the Covid -19 pandemic showed 
how fragile the healthcare systems really are when tested. This is a problem that will 
not go away on its own as the demographic realities of many countries paint a  serious 
picture. In many places there is also a crisis of mental health.  
The pandemic exposed many faults in the way we tackle global crises and we will 
be dealing with the consequences for a long time. While rich countries were able to 
vaccinate their en tire populations that protection was denied those most vulnerable 
in the poorer regions in the world. Meanwhile, it will be a matter for future historians 
to judge if the economic sacrifices made during the pandemic were the worth the 
benefits, or if the w idespread curtailment of individual liberties that we saw, with 
increased social isolation, were the wisest response to the crisis.

Mr/Madam  President.  
It was said in an English poem published 498 years ago that no man is an island. 
Indeed. But not onl y is no man an island, no country is an island. Not even the 
countries, like Iceland, that actually are islands.CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY // EMBARGO TIL DELIVERY

 The decisions made in one part of the world can have great consequences, intended 
or unintended, across the globe. Of course, this applies in p articular to the oceans 
that cover 70% of our planets surface and whose waters do not respect any national 
boundaries.  
For Iceland, sustainable fisheries and a dynamic blue economy are critical. It is our 
responsibility to ensure sustainable use and healt h of our oceans for the benefit of 
all. Tackling marine pollution is a priority, in particular plastic waste, and we 
welcome the important steps taken in Nairobi earlier this year.  
Allow me also to highlight the renewed spirit that the Lisbon Ocean Confer ence 
brought us, including increased recognition of the importance of food from the ocean 
in our food systems and for achieving Agenda 2030.  
For 40 years, our Constitution of the Ocean, the UN Convention on the Law of the 
Sea, has served as a solid foundat ion for international cooperation on everything 
related to the oceans. It is a prime example of a diplomatic success that has stood the 
test of time and continues to serve us well.  
With new environmental challenges, along with increased awareness and scientific 
knowledge of the importance and vulnerability of the ocean, the time is ripe to 
conclude negotiations on a new agreement on the conservation and sustainable use 
of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Iceland welcomes the 
progress made during the negotiations last month and is determined to do its part to 
reach an agreement.  
The role of UN and its institutions in these crises is therefore of utmost importance. 
While the current and impending crises we are facing must be deal t with, we mustCHECK AGAINST DELIVERY // EMBARGO TIL DELIVERY

 not neglect the Sustainable Development Goals. The year 2030 is fast approaching 
and yet we are nowhere near the realization of Agenda 2030.  
Iceland aims to shoulder its responsibility, as demonstrated by the increase in Official 
Developmen t Assistance.  
We must  also not give up on our aim of a world free of nuclear weapons. The failure 
to reach a consensus on advancing the implementation of the Nuclear Proliferation 
Treaty only a month ago, in this very hall, is a further testament to the ir responsible 
behavior of the Russian  Federation - a lone opponent of the final document and the 
only state that has lowered the threshold for using nuclear weapons by explicitly 
threatening to resort to these weapons of mass destruction.  
*** 
Mr/Madam  President.  
""All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."" The world cannot 
afford to deny anyone the opportunity to contribute to the solutions that we 
collectively need.  
Too widely, we are witnessing an increase in repression of religi ous and ethnic 
minorities, racism, anti -semitism and violent nationalism. Autocratic tendancies and 
voices that seek to intensify political polarization are on the rise.  
Iceland is remains committed to countering the regression we have witnessed in the 
rights of women and girls in too many places around the world. The rights of LGBTI 
people across the world have either never been secured or have regressed.  
The values and principles embodied in the UN Charter, international law and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights are not only important in and of themselvesCHECK AGAINST DELIVERY // EMBARGO TIL DELIVERY

 - they are absolutely critical if we are to harness the individual creativity, 
entrepreneurial spirit and innovative mindset that we need to rely on in our quest for 
man-made solutions to our man -made problems.  
These ideals are another example of how the method of solving problems is a more 
pressing matter to resolve than any individual problem. And we know that the answer 
to humanity's challenges lies in the human spirit itself, if it is allowed t o live out its 
truest potential.  
*** 
Mr/Madam  President.  
The job of leaders is not easy when the times require sacrifices.  
We are all aware of the challenges that open societies face. Freedom of expression 
means that it is possible to spread lies and false information. This is a real problem 
that we need to address.  
Free societies need to become more resilient with a strong, well -educated, and well -
informed public being the first and best line of defense against those who seek to 
manipulate with lies, conspiracy theories and hate mongering.  
However, when we worry about the misuse of the freedom of expression in open 
societies, let us not forget that the truly terrifying misuse of information is when 
governments claim a monopoly on truth. Relentless prop aganda and brain washing 
by official sources in corrupt governments with evil intentions can lead to a truly 
terrifying result. This is what we have seen in Russia where all form of public debate 
and independent thinking has been criminalised.CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY // EMBARGO TIL DELIVERY  
 
 
9 
 A society wh ere people hesitate to criticize - or even ridicule - authority, the official 
truth or the established narrative - is not truly free.  
For the peoples of the world to be able to find the transformative solutions that  the 
world so desperately needs, people m ust be able to challenge the status quo. They 
must be free to express their opinions and debate freely on even the most sensitive 
issues. They must also be free to create art, even if the art is distasteful.  
These are the values that the defenders of Ukra ine want to secure for their children.  
These are the values that Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya is demanding for the people of 
Belarus.  
These values are being denied to Afghan women and girls under the Taliban regime.  
These are the values that do not accept that  Mahsa Amini is beaten to death in Iran 
for wearing a hijab incorrectly.  
And - let us not forget - that the Russian government is not only guilty of horrific 
abuses on the international scene. Brave Russians resistors to Putin’s system, or the 
thousands th at showed up on the streets of Russia earlier this week - are all subject 
to harsh punishments, wrongful imprisonment, persecution and often worse.  
*** 
The almost 500 -year-old little poem by John Donne I quoted before includes another 
famous line. As it d iscusses how interconnected the world was in 1524 - it says “And 
therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls” - meaning that we should view 
it as our duty to respond to common challenges, and not look the other way or wait 
for others to act. We mu st answer the call.CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY // EMBARGO TIL DELIVERY  
 
 
10 
 Even if the challenges we face were not created by the younger generations, and they 
were not created by the poor of the world. Nevertheless, all of humanity will have to 
take part in solving them.  
So - whether we like it or not - whet her we deserve or not - it falls to the leaders of 
today and tomorrow to face our common reality. And, whether we like it or not - and 
whether we deserve it or not - this we must do together.  
We must all answer the call.  
We must answer the call to stand wi th Ukraine.  
We must answer the call to defend the multilateral system.  
It is also us, who must answer the call to defend our nature and fight back against 
climate change and fight poverty and deprivation.  
And finally, we must answer the call to defend the rights of individuals and give 
them the opportunity to contribute to the solutions that are so desperately needed.  
If we do not, we have failed.

Mr/Madam  President.  
I am thankful for the opportunity to address this 77th General Assembly and once 
again be reminded that the possibility for nations to come together, and exchange 
ideas and opinions in a civilised manner remains the norm in international relations, 
and that those who break the rules are almost universally condemned.  
The noble aim  of this organization, to spare the world from the sorrows of war, is 
maybe more relevant their ever before. Order in the world must be restored.CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY // EMBARGO TIL DELIVERY

OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA  
AT THE GENERAL DEBATE  
OF THE 77TH SESSION OF THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY  
NEW YORK, 2 6 SEPTEMBER 2022  
 
 
Mr. President,  
 
1. Many Leaders have spoken here over the past few days.  
 
2. We share the same concerns.  
 
3. The current state of our worl d… is very worrying . 
 
4. The pandemic p ersists… and global economy remains sluggish.  
 
5. War among nations is no longer a possibility… but has become a 
reality.  
 
6. Violation of international law has become a norm … in pursuit of 
narrow self -interest.  
 
7. Crisis after crisis … is unfolding around the world.  
 
→  Climate change… rising inflation… food and energy shortages.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
8. History teaches us… these phenomena … might lead … to a huge 
war. 
 
9. Let us look … at the perio d leading up … to Second World War.  
 
10. The Great Depression… rise of ultranationalism… competition over 
resources… and rivalry between major powers.  
 
11. These are very similar … to what we are facing  today.  
 
12. Clearly … we have been handling these challenges the wrong way.  
 
13. We have been divided… instead of united.14. We have been working individually… instead of collectively.  
 
15. We have been focusing on words… instead of deeds.  
 
16. The question now… what are we going to do about it?  
 
17. Are we going to continue the same path?  
 
18. Or are we going to choose a different path?  
 
19. If we continue the same path… we would be heading towards a 
disaster . 
 
0. But if we choose a different path… we might stand a chance.  
 
21. So, today I would like to offer you… a world order based on a new 
paradigm . 
 
22. A paradigm of win -win… not of zero -sum.  
 
23. A paradigm of engagement… not of containment.  
 
24. A paradigm of collaboration… not of competition.  
 
25. This is the transformative soluti on that we need.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
26. Allow me to share with you… why we need this new paradigm.  
 
27. FIRST … to reignite the spirit of peace.  
 
28. Trust deficit breeds hatred and fear… and may lead into a conflict.  
 
29. We witnessed  these phenomena in many parts of the world.  
 
30. We must turn trust deficit … into strategic trust … 
 
31. And it starts with upholding respect for international law…  
 
32. The fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity … 
are non-negotiable.3. I repeat…  the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial 
integrit y… are non -negotiable.  
 
34. These principles must always be upheld.  
 
35. Meanwhile, p eaceful solution is the only option… to settle any 
conflicts.  
 
36. Habit of dialogue and cooperation … would nurture strategic trust.  
 
37. These are the rules of the game that we must maintain… if we truly 
want peace.  
 
38. It is our responsibility to apply them  consistently … not 
selectively … or only when we see fit.  
 
39. My President conveyed these messages of peace… in his visits to 
Kyiv and Moscow last June.  
 
40. We must also apply this new paradigm… to make a breakthrough … 
in Palestine  and Afghanistan . 
 
41. For far too long, the peoples in Palestine have suffered … and 
longed for peace . 
 
42. Until Palestine can truly become an independent State… Indonesia 
would stand  firm in solidarity … with our Palestinian brothers and 
sisters.  
 
43. Peoples in Afghanistan also deserve a peaceful and prosperous 
life… 
 
→  where the rights of all peoples… including women… are equally 
respected … and  
 
→ where access to education for women and girls is granted.  
 
44. Without this new paradigm… peace would remain an elusive dream.  
 
45. SECOND … to revive our responsibility  for global  recovery.  
 
46. We are  concerned that global solidarity is fading away…→  whereas injustice and selfishness  abound …  
→ the weak stands small… and the mighty takes all.  
 
47. We are seeing the symptoms every day.  
 
48. Trade discrimination is running rampant.  
 
49. Monopoly in global supply chain persists.  
 
50. Global economic governance is used … to justify the rules of the 
strong.  
 
51. The pandemic teaches us a valuable lesson… that no one is safe 
until everyone is.  
 
52. This lesson shapes … the priorities of Indonesia’s G20 Presidency.  
 
53. The whole world is pinning their hope on G20… to be a catalyst of 
global recovery … especially for developing countries.  
 
54. G20 must not fail … We cannot let global recovery fall at the 
mercy of geopolitics.  
 
55. We must act urgently to address food and energy crises… and 
prevent a fertilizer crisis from happening.  
 
56. Otherwise, billions more people would be at risk… particularly in 
developing countries.  
 
57. We also need a new paradigm… as we move beyond the recovery.  
 
58. A new paradigm would instill a collective responsibility … to attain the 
2030 Agenda…  and fight climate change.  
 
59. Without this new paradigm… there would not be  a strong recovery 
for all… and many of us would be left behind.  
 
60. THIRD … to bolster  regional partnership.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
61. In many places … post -War regional architecture was built… as a tool 
for containment… and alienation.62. This phenomenon continues today with mini -lateral groupings.  
 
63. Many become part of a proxy war between major powers.  
 
64. This is not what regional architecture should be.  
 
6. It must serve as the building block for peace and stability… rather 
than undermining them.  
 
66. ASEAN was built exactly for this purpose…  
 
67. We refuse to be a pawn… in a new Cold War.  
 
68. Instead, we actively promote  the paradigm of collaboration with all 
countries … 
 
69. This paradigm will also guide Indonesia’s Chairmanship in ASEAN 
next year.  
 
70. It is the commitment  of Indonesia … 
 
→ to forge ASEAN’s unity… as a locomotive for peace, stability, 
and prosperity in the region…  
 
→  to reinforce ASEAN’s centrality… in shaping regional order… in 
the Indo -Pacific…  
 
→ and to ensure ASEAN matters… for our peoples, for the region, 
and for the world.  
 
71. ASEAN will also continue to address seriously  the situation in 
Myanmar…  
 
72. Indonesia is deeply concerned by the military’s lack of commitment… 
to implement the Five -Point Consensus.  
 
73. ASEAN must move forward...  and not be taken hostage by the 
situation in Myanmar.  
 
74. The support of the international community… in particular the 
neighboring countries of Myanmar… is very important… to bring back 
democracy in Myanmar.75. On Pacific,  Indonesia will continue to strengthen our cooperation 
with the Pacific  countries . 
 
7. We will work together to address our shared challenges… including 
on climate change.  
 
77. As a Pacific nation ourselves… we want to see t he Pacific as an 
integral part… of a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Indo -Pacific.  
 
Mr. President,  
 
78. The new paradigm of collaboration  must be the spirit of the UN.  
 
79. Inclusive and meaningful engagement … must trump … above take  it 
or leave  it approach…  
 
→  Whereas the voices of all countries… big and small… developed 
and developing… equally matter . 
 
80. This is the very foundation of multilateralism.  
 
81. That is why we need a strong and reformed UN.  
 
82. That is why we need a renewed multilateralism… that is fit for 
purpose … that is fit for its time.  
 
83. That is why we need a multilateralism that delivers.  
 
84. I believe… by working together… and adopting a new paradigm… we 
can create a better world for all.  
 
85. It is no longer the time to talk the talk…  
 
86. Now is the time to walk the talk.  
 
87. Thank you.

 BTN_77_2022,"(Check against delivery) Statement by H.E. Lyonpo (Dr)Tandi Dorji, Foreign Minister of the Kingdom of Bhutan, 77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly September 26th , 2022 “A watershed moment: Transformative solutions to interlocking challenges” Mr. President,  Mr. Secretary General,  Excellencies,  Distinguished Delegates,  1.I bring you the warm greetings of His Majesty the King, and from the people of Bhutan.  2.Allow me to convey our congratulations to H.E. Mr. Csaba Kőrösi, the President of the 77th UNGA. Please rest assured, Mr. President, of Bhutan’s full support as you steer us through the session. I also take the opportunity to convey our gratitude and admiration for H.E. Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the 76th General Assembly, for the exceptional manner in which he guided our work this past tumultuous year.   3.Our appreciation is also due to the Secretary General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, who, in a most challenging year for our Organization, coinciding with the first year of his second term, has continued to serve as a compelling and valiant advocate for peace, people, and planet. Mr. President,  4.I arrived in New York last week with a vastly different prepared text for delivery today.  In recent days, however, I received a heartfelt appeal from Chimi, a bright seven year old girl in class two at Lunana Primary School, in Bhutan which has compelled me to rethink my statement.   5.Lunana is a place in one of our northernmost districts, remote and perched at an altitude of 3400m.  It is home to a community of 810 people, comprising 185 households of highland nomadic herders, spread across 13 scattered villages.  Today, Lunana is embraced in the astounding beauty of rugged snow capped peaks of the mighty Himalayas, which Lunaps, or the people of 1Lunana, both revere and depend upon for their livelihood and sustenance.  Each time that Chimi and members of her community glance at these majestic peaks, the  foremost question on their mind is - “How long before they become barren and brown?” 6.I would like to share young Chimi’s letter with you today: It reads -  “Your Excellency,  My village is in great danger because of Global Warming. The glaciers and snow on our mountains are melting, the glacial lakes above our village are getting bigger every day. I am sure it may cause a big flood in our village at anytime.  And we have to be in constant fear every day and night. Our innocent people are suffering because of others’ evil actions. In near future we may not see glaciers and snow on the mountains, beautiful glacial lakes and Lunaps in this place. Therefore, I would request your Excellency to kindly convey this small message to the world leaders, and big and rich nations to help and save our tiny village from Global Warming.   I am sure if we all come together, we can not only save our tiny village but also make our Earth safe for all living beings.   I think we are not late to fight against Global warming now.” 7.Chimi’s poignant letter evokes the plain truths of communities standing on the frontlines of the climate crisis.  But this is not limited to Bhutan.  We are reminded with far too much frequency that across the world today, lives and livelihoods are in peril due to the impacts of human induced climate change, rising sea levels, and natural disasters. The negative impacts of climate change are disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable and marginalised communities around the world, and doing so, at a faster pace.  The future of our youth and successive generations are under immediate threat.  And the great irony is that it is through no fault of their own.   28.But it is not too late!  There is still time to undertake course correction, but that window of opportunity is fast closing.  This calls for demonstration of greater ambition from developed and large emitters, consistent with the Paris Agreement.  We must see deeper emission reductions in keeping with a fair share of global efforts, consistent with 1.5 degree pathways.  At the same time, we must see greater solidarity and cooperation from all states to support efforts of the most vulnerable to adapt to the changing climate, and deal with all its consequences. 9.We must ensure adequate and predictable finance, technological and capacity support, for developing countries, particularly the LLDCs, LDCs and SIDs, to enable us to achieve the goals and targets of the 200 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement. We need to forge strong international cooperation in coming up with viable projects and partnerships to scale up investments in alternative renewable energy, to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, particularly in the manufacturing and transport sectors. 10.Bhutan hopes that the urgency to move beyond business as usual will be heeded at COP27 this November. Mr. President, 11.In Bhutan, our visionary Monarchs have long recognised the importance of conserving our natural environment and living in harmony with nature. Although small, we have made bold commitments to safeguard nature, and protect our environment - most significant of which is the constitutional requirement of maintaining 60% of our total area under forest cover for all time to come, although in reality, over 70% of our territory is forested.  Our forests are net carbon sinks, absorbing two thirds more carbon than we emit.  Bhutan is not just carbon neutral, but carbon negative.   12.In a world heading towards a water, food and energy crisis, investing in sustainable mountain development should be a global priority. 13.We need to build resilience of our communities, offer mountain communities practical and sustainable alternatives to enable them to continue living in harmony with nature and their surroundings.  We must continue to foster sustainable mountain development with special emphasis on mountain agriculture, sustainable mountain tourism and opportunities to tap renewable 3energy that the mountains provide. The adoption last year, proclaiming 2022 as the International Year of Sustainable Mountain Development, brought the spotlight on sustainable mountain development, its conservation and sustainable use, as integral means of protecting the common heritage of our planet.   14.To put focus and raise awareness, we are organising an annual ultra marathon event known as the Snowman Race that will take elite athletes from around the world to run across the Himalayas at elevations of 5000 meters above sea level. We hope that this will generate more action and enhance greater partnerships.  Mr. President, 15.We are at a watershed moment in history. The world today faces an unprecedented series of interlinked and cascading crises.  The human race continues on a collision course with nature, battling against the climate, biodiversity, and pollution. 16.At the same time, the pandemic that surfaced in March 2020 is still with us, and rather than abate, continues to morphe and reinvent itself in new and more virulent strains. Outbreaks of other viral infections continue to occur at alarmingly frequent intervals, threatening the world with another possible pandemic. It is certain that these biological threats will continue and that we need to be better prepared. 17.As with many other parts of the world, Bhutan was not spared the impacts of COVID-19 nor its induced disruptions.  We are fortunate that with our beloved Monarch leading from the front, with government policies and measures firmly grounded in science, and most importantly of all, with full solidarity and confidence of our people behind us, Bhutan was fortunate to fare better than many others. As a result of stringent measures, determination, and grit, we were able to minimize the immediate public health impacts of the COVID19 pandemic, emerging with minimum loss of life.  Our campaign to vaccinate our population has been recognised as an unlikely success story, and today, more than 90% of our entire population stand fully vaccinated.  This, in no small measure, was possible due to the heart warming goodwill of friends and partners, including India, whose Vaccine Maitri initiative enabled the full first round of vaccinations for our adult population. We are also grateful to the United States, Denmark, 4Bulgaria, Croatia, and China, whose generosity with vaccines came at a most critical time. We also thank all the other bilateral partners and multilateral agencies that supported logistics and provided financial support, medicines and equipment for our response to the pandemic. Our success would not have been possible without all of your support. 18.Just when we were embarking on rebuilding and recovering from the pandemic and its associated impacts, we were struck by conflict that resulted in supply disruptions, surge in food, energy, and fertilizer crisis. Record high food prices have triggered a global crisis that will drive millions more into extreme poverty, magnifying hunger and malnutrition. Predictably, it is the poorest and most vulnerable amongst us that suffer the brunt. The Secretary General rightly described this as either a breakdown or breakthrough moment for humanity and for the planet. 19.Transformation is what we called for in the Political Declaration of the UN’s 75th Anniversary.  We thank the Secretary General, for his groundbreaking report on Our Common Agenda responding to this call.  Bhutan has followed closely the discussions around the report and its recommendations, and we are pleased with the momentum that has been generated. As we continue our deliberations, Bhutan will engage constructively, including in preparations for the Summit of the Future and work towards elaboration of a Global Digital Compact. 20.Our Common Agenda must provide the roadmap to “‘turbo charge” and accelerate our actions towards achieving the 2030 agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. Bhutan welcomes the report’s recognition of the need to look beyond GDP.  This finds strong resonance with Bhutan’s own approach to balanced and human centered development that we call Gross National Happiness.  It is now widely accepted that this can not be achieved by tracking GDP alone. Bhutan has always believed that pursuit of development and progress must respond to a higher calling.  We need measures that take into account the full spectrum of human development, as well as the multifaceted factors that provide the enabling environment, within which individuals can pursue and achieve that common human aspiration yet elusive goal of happiness and wellbeing. This discussion assumes greater urgency as we approach the midpoint towards implementing the 2030 Agenda, in full realization that today, the conflict in Europe and the looming climate emergency, have thrown efforts towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and SDGs - off course. We need to re-focus our priorities by shifting 5gears and turning our commitments into action, and doing so by working together in the spirit of genuine solidarity.  21.Bhutan welcomed the convening of the Transforming Education Summit on 19th September. His Majesty the King has always accorded the highest importance to the education sector, recognising that a nation’s fate begins in its classrooms and schools. Education is a critical pillar of a country’s development, and holds the key to unlocking many of our shared global challenges.  As His Majesty The King remarked as early as 2014 - and I quote “Education is empowering – it is a social equalizer and it facilitates self-discovery, which leads to realizing one’s full potential. Good education gives you confidence, good judgement, virtuous disposition, and the tools to achieve happiness successfully. A good school gives a child a fair shot at success and ensures that a person’s achievement in life will not be predetermined by his or her race, parentage and social connections.” Mr. President,  22.Bhutan may have been one of the most recent countries to finally reopen its borders since the emergence of the pandemic.  As difficult and painful as these past two and half years have been, they have allowed for deep reflection at the national level, and permitted time for an honest assessment of gaps and challenges.  Weaknesses were bared, in some instances, fault lines deepened.  We came to the harsh realisation that drastic recalibration of our systems were needed if Bhutan is to position itself as a country that is prosperous, resilient, and future ready.   With one year remaining before our exit date from the LDC category,  these measures will buttress our efforts to ensure that Bhutan’s graduation is smooth, sustainable, and irreversible.   23.As I speak, major transformational initiatives are underway in Bhutan to strengthen public service delivery. The entire public sector will be streamlined, strengthened in terms of capacity and performance, held to more rigorous standards of professionalism and accountability.  We hope that our public servants will serve the citizens with better and faster public services that they deserve.   24.While Universal Health Care is a guarantee enshrined in our Constitution, reforms in the health sector focus on the importance of preparedness for future outbreaks and pandemics, strengthening quality of health care, leveraging technology, and a renewed focus on mental health. The health 6sector is being reformed to provide not only primary, but secondary and tertiary health care to all people within half a days travel. Specialist services are expanding across the country including, sending mobile teams to screen and treat high burden diseases.   25.Bhutan’s revamped tourism policy was launched with much anticipation on 23rd September coinciding with the opening of our international border. Since 1974 when Bhutan opened its doors for tourism, we have always followed the policy of High value, Low volume tourism, envisioned by His Majesty the Fourth King. However the minimum daily tariffs that was instituted was found to be too low, resulting in us becoming a budget destination, leading to mass tourism and its associated problems of increasing waste, decreasing quality of service standards, under-employment of our youth engaged in the sector, traffic jams and over-crowding of our most religious sites. We have always prioritized the well being of the people, preserving our environment, our tradition and culture over unsustainable and mindless development. Therefore in keeping with our development philosophy of GNH, the sector has been restructured and reformed so that it benefits Bhutan not only economically, but socially and environmentally. In the long run we want to create high value, authentic and unique experiences for visitors and well paying professional jobs and businesses for our citizens.  Mr. President,  26.The increasing fragmentation, polarization, and growing inequality we witness in the world today, only serve as an urgent cry for strengthening multilateralism, for greater political resolve, solidarity, and compassion.  It is apparent that no individual, community or country can overcome contemporary challenges on their own.  Interdependence is at the core of our existence and we must come together through stronger, more effective multilateralism.  27.Bhutan’s commitment to multilateralism with the UN at its core, remains unwavering.  As a small, landlocked and peaceful country, we remain fully committed to the noble objectives enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Coinciding with the 50th year of membership in the Organisation, which we marked last year, Bhutan responded to the call to contribute to the maintenance of peace and security - a key pillar and objective of the United Nations. Since then, Bhutan has prepared for the deployment of its first uniformed military unit, a Light Quick Reaction Force to a UN peace 7mission.  This process was set in motion in 2014 when we first joined the ranks of UN troop contributing countries. Our well trained troops will arrive to serve the cause of peace in MINUSCA in the weeks ahead.  They will meet the highest standards in performance and accountability and I am confident that they will serve the international community with distinction and honor. It is a matter of great pride that although Bhutan is amongst the smallest members of the United Nations, with this initial deployment, we would rise to the ranks of the top 60 troop contributing countries, from 81 at present.   28.Of particular note, consistent with Bhutan’s deep commitment to promotion and protection of the environment, Bhutan considers that pursuit of environmentally responsible practices in operations as a moral imperative.  We feel strongly that at the minimum, “do no harm” ethic must drive all aspects of field operations and conduct, and that where ever possible, field presences should on their departure, be remembered by local communities for the positive legacies they have left for host countries. 29.Bhutan has therefore pledged that when Bhutan’s uniformed contingent deploys, we will do so in an environmentally sustainable manner with renewable energy, waste management, and provision of assistance to local communities whom we will serve.  The center piece of our pledge is the use of solar panels for lighting purposes in the barracks and camp area.  We will carry out plantation of trees around the company location in accordance with existing policies of the host country. While these pledges are modest, our hope is that they will contribute to the overall environmental efforts of UN peacekeeping, and demonstrate that such practices can be emulated and scaled.   30.Contribution to UN peacekeeping is a significant milestone in the progression of Bhutan’s  engagement with the UN.  We are sincerely thankful to the international community for the trust and confidence reposed in our ability to meaningfully contribute towards the maintenance of international peace and security.  Mr. President,   31. In its 77th year of existence, our Organisation too needs a reboot, to be able to meet the challenges of the present day and future and to keep pace and 8reflect contemporary realities.  It must be reformed to respond more effectively to changed global realities and to new and emerging threats that confront us today. No-where is this more evident nor urgent than in the growing call for comprehensive reform of the United Nations Security Council.  32.Yet we note that 43 years since inclusion of the subject in the General Assembly's Agenda, and nearly three decades since the establishment of the GA’s Open Ended Working Group on UNSC Reform, we have fallen far short.  Lack of progress on UNSC reform throws into question the relevance and legitimacy of the current global architecture, fragilizes international peace and security, and impinges on the Council’s ability to deliver on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.   33.Bhutan has always maintained that reform must accommodate the interest and concerns of all Member States, particularly of those unrepresented and underrepresented. Expansion of the Council in both the permanent and non permanent categories, along with reform of its working methods, constitute essential components of this process.  Excellencies,  34.The current challenges facing the world today  remind us of our inter-dependence and the imperatives of collaboration and solidarity.  While there have been shining examples of international cooperation, we continue to be distrustful, less understanding and driven by self interest.  As the Buddha revealed 2000 years ago, if we are to end suffering we must rid ourselves of its three root causes, also known as the three poisons: IGNORANCE of the nature of impermanence, GREED and HATRED.  It is these that are the main causes of the global problems today. The antidote, and traits we can all draw inspiration from, is said to be WISDOM, SHARING and COMPASSION.  These enduring values find consonance in the essence of the principles enshrined in the UN Charter. Mr. President,  35.I am cognisant of the lofty stature of this august Assembly.  Our deliberations and decisions taken within the General Assembly hall can impact the lives of multitudes across the world, and will remain inscribed in the annals of history.  Let us not forget that all who stand at this rostrum bear 9the solemn responsibility to demonstrate wisdom, courage, and resolve as expected of us by current and future generations.   36.Thank you and Tashi Delek!

Statement by Foreign Secretary and the Leader of Nepali Delegation  
Mr. Bharat Raj Paudyal at the General Debate of the 77th Session of  
United Nations General Assembly  
New York, 26 September 2022  
 
Theme - A Watershed Moment: Transformative Solutions to 
Interlocking Challenges  
 
Words to Read: 2425 
Mr. President,  
Mr. Secretary General,  
Excellencies, and  
Distinguished delegates,  
I begin by congratulating you, Mr . President, on your unanimous election 
to preside over the 77th session of the General Assembly.  
I also express appreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. 
Abdulla Shahid, for successfully steering  the 76th session.  
My deep appreciation goes to UN Secretary -General, Mr. Antonio 
Guterres, for his commendable  efforts to promote global peace, security, 
human rights, and development.  
There could have been no better time to deliberate on ‘ A watershed 
moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges’ , the theme 
of this year’s General Debate. 
 Mr. President,  
We are living indeed in a watershed moment.  
- A moment when the COVID -19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, 
inequalities, and climate crisis threaten our pursuit of peace and 
prosperity;  
- A moment when the values of solidarity and cooperation are put to 
test, with trust and confidence in short supply;  
- A moment when humanity is caught between hope and despair, 
unity and division, and harmony and dissension; and 
- A moment, when the world is striving to forge a new consensus amid  
competing interests, priorities and challenges .  
For the third year in a row, CO VID-19 continues to add strain to our lives, 
livelihoods, and economies.  
But there is a hope . The production and availability of COVID -19 
vaccines  has minimized the risk and severity of the disease and enhanced 
our ability  to save lives .   
In Nepal, we ha ve been able to fully vaccinate 96 percent of the target 
population, with almost everyone receiving at least one dose.  
We thank our immediate neighbours - India and China , our development 
partners , and the United Nations System for their valuable support.  
But this is not the case everywhere. Poor and vulnerable people in many 
parts of world have  still been kept away from the ‘dose of hope,’.  
The pandemic will not end unless it ends for all people in all countries. 
 We must  ensure vaccine equity so that no one is left behind . 
Excellencies,  
The 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals are at risk. 
The pandemic has hit hard on our march into the decade of action.  
This has been followed by cascading crises marked by geopolitical 
divides,  disru ption of supply chain, and climate emergency.  
The resulting h igh food and fuel price, massive inflation , and debt burden 
severely hit the limited fiscal capacity of the poorer countries especially  
the least developed ones.  
All these crises have cumulative negative impact on financing of  the 
SDGs . It is more acute in the countries in special situations like LDCs, 
LLDCs, and SIDS.   
As per the pre -pandemic estimate, Nepal would require an average annual 
investment of 19 billion  US dollars to achieve the SDGs.  With the 
shortfall of financing, our hard -earned development gains are at risk at a 
time we are preparing to graduate from the LDC  status  by 2026.  
However, graduation is our long -held aspiration, and we remain 
committed to using this opportunity to bring a structural transformation to 
the national economy. We will do everything possible to make our 
graduation process smooth, sustainable, and irrevers ible. 
For this, w e need additional international support in the form of 
investment, technology transfer, aid for trade, and technical assistance.  
This is critical for us to recover from the pandemic, rescue the SDGs, and 
turn global partnership into a real ity. 
 Mr. President,  
No country can thrive without integration into the global market.  The 
rising tide of protectionism and stalled trade negotiation are delaying the 
much -needed  reform in international trad ing system , which is tipped in 
favour of some . The poorer countries are yet to  benefit  from it. We must 
ensure open, fair, and transparent trade rules so that all countries can 
benefit  from it .  
Similarly, the current global financial system has seriously failed the 
developing world. It is unfair to continue this undemocratic and 
unresponsive system. We call for the much -needed reform of international 
financial architecture, for making it inclusive , fair,  and equally beneficial 
to all.   
The countries under debt stress  need urgent debt relief, restructuring, and 
cancellation.  The international community must swiftly help them come 
out of their debt crises.    
Mr. President,  
In Nepal, we are bearing the di sproportionate burden of climate change 
and facing climate shocks such as frequent landslides, storms, floods, and 
wildfires.  
The melting of glaciers and the drying -up of snow -fed rivers have been 
adversely affecting the lives and livelihoods of people dow nstream  and 
rendering  us one of the most  vulnerable countries . 
Our region  recently experienced the heartbreaking loss of lives and 
properties due to unusually heavy downpours , melting of the glaciers and 
resulting floods. 
 To combat th e climate  crisis and address vulnerabilities, we have 
localized the  adaptation plans  in Nepal .  
While remaining fully committed to the Paris Agreement, we have set 
ambitious target of r eaching a net -zero scenario by 2045  as announced by 
the Prime Minister of Nepal Rt. Hon. Mr. Sher Bahadur Deuba during the 
COP  26. 
However, c limate change is a global problem,  and it  needs global action. 
For this, the large emitters – which account for over 80 percent of all 
global emissions, must take bold steps to keep the 1.5° Celsius climate 
goal alive.  
The commitment of 100 billion US dollars of climate financing must turn 
into a reality.   
The COP  27 needs to move from pledges into action.  
Distinguished Delegates,  
Geopolitics and polarization have pushed global peace and security  into 
peril. The world is becoming more complex  with rising transnational 
challenges such as terrorism, radicalism, extremism, and mass migration.  
Today, the world faces the highest number o f violent conflicts since 1945, 
within and between countries, divided by  the fault lines of  race, religion, 
ethnicity  and origin.  
The question  that keeps  us haunting  today  is whether  enough  is being  done  
to protect  the people  from  the scourge  of wars,  preventing  them  from  
happening  in the first place.  Investment in the prevention of conflicts is 
more effective than addressing their consequences. 
 The technological  advancement  today  has the capacity  to inflict  
devastating  physical  action  instantly . And yet, it is appalling  to see how 
our world  body  gets crippled  when  it comes  to the interplay  of interests  
of the major  powers  at the Security  Council.     
As our dependence  on new technology  deepens , the issue  of cyber  security  
emerges  as one of the greatest  challenges  that demands  our collective  
resolve  to setting  norms  and building  capacity  to prevent  the threat  it 
poses.  We must also put in place the necessary safeguards to curb the 
malicious use of new technologies.  
Mr. President,  
In 2021, global military spending surpassed two trillion US 
dollars.   Countries are chasing an elusive notion of security by leaving 
behind billions of people hungry, si ck, and destitute. Genuine security 
depends on the ability to address the underlying causes of conflict - 
poverty, hunger, and unemployment.  
Stockpile of nuclear arsenals  constitutes perpetual  threat to humanity. 
Therefore, e limination of them  is the only  guarantee of the non -use of 
these weapons in the future.  
Nepal reiterates its call for general and complete disarmament of all 
weapons of mass destruction, including biological, chemical, nuclear and 
radiological weapons in a time -bound manner.  
Nepal opp oses the arms race in outer space and emphasize on the peaceful 
use of it for the benefit of humankind.  
As the host of the UN Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia 
and the Pacific, Nepal continues to support regional disarmament 
initiatives as building blocks of global disarmament. We remain 
 committed to reviving the Kathmandu Process, which we believe 
complements  global arms control and disarmament  efforts . 
Nepal condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and calls for 
an early conclusion of a comprehensive convention against terrorism.  
Mr. President,  
We are deeply concerned about the deaths and suffering of civilians in the 
war in Ukraine. We call for  an urgent cessation of hostilities and violence 
and urge all concerned parties to exercise maximum restraint and return 
to the path of dialogue.  
Nepal opposes any threat or use of force against the territorial integrity, 
political independence, and sovere ignty of a country under any pretext 
and circumstance.  
Afghanistan has remained on the precipice of uncertainties and violence. 
The Afghan people are exposed to a shocking level of poverty and 
humanitarian sufferings.  
We call that unhindered humanitarian aid and public services including 
health and education for all sections of the Afghan society must be 
ensured.  
We urge all parties concerned in Myanmar to respect the will of the people 
to elect their representatives, paving the way to restore the democra tic 
process.  
The people in Libya, Syria, and Yemen have been facing hardships and 
sufferings for a long. The concerned parties need to resort to peaceful 
means of conflict resolution to end the violence and return to peace. 
 Protracted violence and confl icts continue to inflict pain and suffering on 
Palestinian and Israeli civilians. Nepal reiterates its long -standing view 
for a two -state solution, whereby Palestine and Israel live side by side in 
peace and security within the recognized international bor ders.  
Excellencies,  
Distinguished Delegates,  
Nepal pursues path of democratic system with people’s welfare at the 
centre . Our democratic process is characterized by people’s struggle, 
sacrifice, dialogue, and resilience.  
In May this year, we successfully held democratic elections to the local 
governments in peaceful, free, and fair manner. We are now set to hold 
periodic elections for federal parliament and provincial assemblies in 
November.  
For a democracy like Nepal, these are much more than just periodic 
elections. They are the testament to our ability of ensur ing peaceful 
transfer of power. They are the means to enhan ce people’s trust in 
democracy, promote legitimacy and accountability, and strengthen the 
rule of law.  
The principles of inclusion and participation constitute the core of Nepal’s 
governance system.  The Constitution of Nepal guarantees the 
proportional re presentation and participation of all sections of  our society 
in national life. It guarantees at least 33 percent representation of women 
in federal and provincial parliaments and 40 percent at the local level.  
As a result, the participation of women, you th, and disadvantaged groups 
has increased significantly in politics and other spheres of national life. It 
has not only ensured their rightful place but also injected dynamism, 
justice, and fairness into society. 
 Mr. President,  
Nepal’s commitment to human  rights is unequivocal . The Constitution of 
Nepal incorporates universally recognized human rights and fundamental 
freedoms. As a member of the Human Rights Council for the second 
consecutive term, Nepal continues to add value to the work of the Council.  
Our approach to human rights is firmly grounded in the principles of 
universality, indivisibility, objectivity, and non -selectivity.  
We are committed to concluding the transitional justice process by 
addressing the concerns of the victims, complyi ng with the directive of 
the Supreme Court, abiding  by the spirit of Comprehensive Peace Accord 
and our relevant international commitments. Taking this in earnest, the 
Government of Nepal presented an amendment Bill to the Parliament to 
reform the related laws.  
We uphold  the rights  of the child  as the most  sacred  obligation  of the State  
with their protection,  wellbeing,  health,  education,  and development  at the 
centre.   
We attach high importance to the safety, security, dignity, and well -being 
of migrant wo rkers and emphasize on the effective implementation of the 
Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.   
We also attach  high importance  on quality  education,  skills,  
entrepreneurship  and employment  to the youth  to unleash  their potentials  
for sustained  economic  development , peace,  and prosperity  in society .  
We recognize the significant  role that diaspora can play to bring  capital, 
technology  and skills to the country of  origin.  
Though we are not a party to the Refugee Convention and its Protocol, we 
have been hosting thousands of refugees on humanitarian grounds. 
 We believe that forced eviction of citizens, anywhere and under any 
circumstances, is a grave crime. Refugees’ right to return to their 
homeland in safety, honour, and dignity must always be ensured.  
Excellencies,  
The cardinal principle of ‘seeing the world as one family’ shapes our 
worldview in external relations.   
Our foreign policy dwells on the notions of peace, no n-violence, and non -
aggression, which find their eloquent expression in the teachings of 
Gautam Buddha, the enlightened son of  Nepal.  
Nepal enjoys  cordial relations with all  countries around the world . This is 
a result of both my country’s historical evolution  and the friendly nature 
of our people . Given the goodwill Nepal receives from our friends, we 
feel it to contribute more for international peace, progress and social 
justice.    
We engage with our neighbours and friends in  the internati onal 
community based on the principles of the UN Charter, non -alignment, 
Panchsheel , international law, and the norms of world peace. We play 
active roles in SAARC, BIMSTEC and ACD to promote regional 
cooperation.  
Our partnership with the UN has been built on the foundation of trust  and 
cooperation.   
We firmly believe in multilateralism with the U nited Nations  at its centre. 
With its unmatched coverage, legitimacy and convening power, the 
United Nations  is the most appropriate forum  for promoting global 
cooperation based on sovereign equality and mutual respect. 
 Currently the second -largest troops and police contributing country, 
Nepal has been a consistent contributor to UN peacekeeping for the last 
six and a half decades. We have deployed our peacekeepers at every call 
and without caveat, even in difficult situations .  
Nepal supports all major initiatives aimed at reforming UN peace 
operations.  We have endorsed the Kigali principles, the Action for 
Peacekeeping (A4P), and A4P+ init iatives, among others. We have zero -
case policy against sexual exploitation and abuse in peace operations.  
We condemn the targeted attacks against the blue helmets. Perpetrators of 
such crimes should be brought to justice.  
We believe that countries should have fair share of leadership positions at 
the headquarters and in the field according to the level and history of their 
contribution to UN peacekeeping.  
Nepal supports UN reform initiatives, including revitalizing the General 
Assembly and reforming the Security Council, to make it more 
representative, inclusive, and transparent.  
We also support reform initiatives based on the Secretary -General’s report 
‘Our Common Agenda’ . 
These endeavours will not pro duce results unless the  Member States take 
bold and transformative steps to make our organization fit for the future.  
We must enable the UN to deliver on the needs of the furthest behind first.   
To conclude , Mr. President,  the decisions we make today wil l determine 
what our future will look like.  Our choice to act or not to act will have a 
huge impact on generations to come.  
Let us look at what opportunities lie ahead of us. 
 Let us give solidarity and cooperation a chance.  
As a peace -loving country, Nep al remains  committed to contributing to 
our collective efforts of making this world  peaceful, prosperous, and 
equitable.  
I thank you for your attention.", NPL,2022

Statement by Head of the DPRK Delegation  
H.E. Mr. KIM SONG,  
Perman ent Representative  of the  
Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea to the United Nations  
at the General Debate of the 7 7th session of the  
United Natio ns General Assembly  
(New York, 2 6 Septe mber 202 2) 
 
Mr. President,  
Mr. Secretary General,  
Distinguished Delegates,  
May I begin by congratulating you, Mr. Csaba Korösi, on your election as 
President of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am 
confident that this session, unde r your able stewardship, will be crowned with a 
success.  
I also expect that the current meeting will serve as a meaningful occasion for 
all UN member states to find a common solution through exchanges of useful 
experiences in tiding over the existing chall enges and cr ises and building a 
sustainable world for ourselves as well as the future of coming generations.  
Mr. President,  
Over the last three years since the outbreak of the once -in-a-century 
pandemic, this malignant virus has taken the precious lives of  more than 6 .53 
 million people. And it still poses a threat to the existence of humankind, making 
sub-variants strong in transmission and immunity evasion. To make matters worse, 
the global health crisis is compounded by newly emerging infectious diseases such 
as monk ey pox.  
This year has seen immense human and material losses in all regions of the 
world including South Asia, Western Europe and North America due to the 
destructive effects of the disaster -prone abnormal weather resulting from the 
climate ch ange. This h as created yet another difficult problem to the international 
community.  
Moreover, the global security environment is plunging into the worst state 
since the World War II owing to the high -handedness and arbitrariness of some 
countries attempt ing to repla ce the current international order centered on the UN 
system with a “rules -based international order” governed by the unilateral and 
exclusive Western values.  
The UN was founded in reflection of the expectations and desire of 
humankind who want ed to see no  more repetition of the scourge of the world wars 
that inflicted indescribable misfortune upon them. The present reality urgently 
calls for the UN to promote more than ever before cooperation and reconciliation, 
and unity and solidarity among i ts member st ates, and to discharge its righteous 
missions and role.  
Mr. President,  
The world was faced with challenges and difficulties of all sorts during the 
last year. The DPRK was no exception.  
This notwithstanding, the DPRK has scored valuable success es in protec ting 
the life and safety of the people from the threat of malignant pandemic and in 
achieving overall development of the country while persistently overcoming the 
difficulties and obstacles on its own.  
I hope that the successes and experi ences gained by th e DPRK will make a 
positive contribution to the deliberation of the theme before the current session of 
 the General Assembly for overcoming interlocking challenges and finding 
transformative solutions by the international community.  
The u nprece dented crisi s caused by the malignant virus spread throughout 
our state from late last April. It presented a very critical ordeal and served as an 
occasion to test national crisis preparedness capacity of the country.  
But the DPRK government made a c orrect  analysis of  the features of the 
malignant virus and the circumstances of its outbreak together with the state of the 
public health of the country. On this basis, it lost no time in putting forward an 
anti-epidemic policy in a scientific, transparent  and s peedy manner  so as to take 
strategic initiative in preventing the infectious disease, and proceeded with its 
implementation with due care, thus achieving a decisive victory in exterminating 
the malignant virus in a very short period of 100 -odd days.  
High s ense of orga nization and voluntary unity of action, and the social ethos 
of helping and caring about each other are the superiority of the political system 
peculiar to our country. This served as a fundamental guarantee for successful 
implementation of the  scientific anti-epidemic policy.  
In terms of anti -epidemic and public health foundations, our country has 
been in a weaker condition than other countries. But it took the contagious disease 
under control at the shortest period of time. All this is t he bri lliant resul t brought 
by the DPRK government’s correct anti -epidemic policy and the superior socialist 
system.  
The DPRK government is closely following the anti -epidemic situation of 
the neighboring countries and the world. At the same time, it is s teppin g up its 
work to build the national anti -epidemic capacity to actively cope with any public 
health crisis in the present and the future and to fully secure the life and safety of 
the people.  
Upon authorization, I take this opportunity to express than ks to those 
countr ies and international organizations that have shown their deep interest and 
willingness to render assistance to the anti -epidemic work of our country. 
 Despite the inevitable difficulties and obstacles caused by the global health 
crisis an d abno rmal weather  conditions, the DPRK government achieved new 
successes and progress by propelling without interruption the works for national 
development and stabilization and improvement of the people’s livelihood.  
Industry, agriculture and all o ther sectors  of the econ omy are showing the 
trend of steady and stable growth. And the works to supply the people with 
modern apartments free of charge and provide the children and pupils all across 
the country with nutritious food, new school uniforms and  stationery materials at  
state’s expense are being carried forward as planned.  
Subjective and objective conditions and environment are still unfavorable. 
But visible and substantial progress and advances are being made in our country in 
the social atmosphe re which is full of vim and vigor. This reality of our country 
substantiates the fact that we can successfully overcome any difficulty and 
challenge if we rely on the strength of the people to implement the policies that 
suit the reality on the ground.  
Mr. President,  
The successe s achieved by the DPRK in its state and social development are 
not something which was by no means made under peaceful and quiet 
environment.  
The security environment of the Korean peninsula is now caught in a vicious 
cycle of tensi on and confr ontation due  to the increasing hostility of the US and its 
following forces against the DPRK. Recently, it is heading into a much more 
dangerous phase.  
One of the trump excuses of the US and its servile forces to justify their 
hostile policy a nd military threats agai nst the DPRK is none other than the 
possession of our self -defensive nuclear weapons.  
A few days ago, the US president, just at this place, picked on us saying that 
despite their ""efforts to begin serious and sustained diplomacy"", t he DPRK 
continues to bla tantly violate UN “sanctions”. 
 To put it clearly, we have never recognized such “resolutions” of the UN that 
impose pressure because we do not abide by its ""rules"" made by the US 
unilaterally. We will not accept them in the future, too. 
In addi tion to our country, there exist a number of countries in the world 
which possess nuclear weapons. But only the DPRK has been subjected to the 
most brigandish and brutal “sanctions resolutions”. This is because the UN 
connived at and allowed th e high -hande dness and ar bitrariness of the U.S. 
antagonizing the independent DPRK with an absurd reason that it differs in its 
ideas and systems and opposes its unjust policy.  
The US is now planning even at this moment to conduct joint military 
exercises w hich draw se rious concer n in the surrounding of the Korean peninsula. 
Obviously, this is an extremely dangerous act of igniting the fuse to drive the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.  
Mr. President,  
The DPRK has found another cor rect answer to def ending its s overeignty 
and fundamental interests from the persistent hostile policy and military threat of 
the U.S. and its following forces and to ensuring peace and security on the Korean 
peninsula and in the region.  
At the recent seven th session of the 14th Supreme  People’s Assembly (SPA) 
of DPRK, law on the policy of the nation’s nuclear forces has been adopted with 
unanimous approval in reflection of the general will of all Korean people.  
 In direct proportion to the increase of the h ostile policy and military 
blackmail by the US against us, our strength is bound to be built up continuously 
to contain them.  
The US compelled the DPRK to adopt a law on the policy of nuclear forces 
in defiance of the US hostility. The US should clearly un derstand that its heinous 
hostile policy against the DPRK over the past 30 years has just brought about the 
today's reality and ask and answer itself and ponder over how far it would lead this 
situation in the future. 
 Mr. President,  
In his policy speech gi ven at the Seventh  Session of the 14th Supreme 
People’s Assembly, Comrade Kim Jong Un, President of the State Affairs of the 
DPRK, said that present international situation shows that the contradictions 
between justice and injustice and between the progres sive and the react ionary, 
especially the power structure surrounding the Korean peninsula, have become 
obvious and the change from a unipolar world advocated by the US into a 
multipolar world is being accelerated significantly.  
Today, the world is faced wi th not a few sever e crises and  challenges, but the 
most fundamental danger is the high -handedness and arbitrariness of the U.S. and 
its followers that are destroying the foundation of the international peace and 
stability in order to maintain the hegemonic  unipolar world.  
The “rules -based international order” advocated by the U.S. is no less than 
the U.S -centered international order permeated with unilateral and hegemonic 
American values. It is also an imperialistic power structure which gives 
precedence to  the interests of the U.S. ove r the common interests of humankind 
and international law, demanding other countries’ obedience.  
The U.S., having divided the world into “democratic state” and 
“authoritarian state”, is now forcing other countries to choose b etween the two and  
seek confro ntation between the camps. And it attempts to maintain world 
hegemony by expanding the bilateral and multilateral military alliance system 
which are legacy of the Cold War.  
The prevailing reality urgently calls on the UN  entrusted with maintain ing 
global p eace and security and safeguarding international justice to fully discharge 
its missions and role enshrined in the Charter, strictly adhering to the principles of 
impartiality and objectivity.  
The UN is the most universa l international organiza tion bringin g together all 
the sovereign countries. As such, an individual country or a minority group can 
never represent the UN. 
 All the UN activities should be duly oriented to realizing the common 
interests and prosperity of the  member states. To this end, the bas ic formula for 
solution of the problems should be the decision -making which reflects not the 
individual interests of a few countries, but the legitimate and just demands and 
opinions of all the member states.  
The UNSC i s the very organization where impart iality and objectivity are not 
ensured in the UN activities.  
The mere fact that the UNSC makes an issue of the exercise of the legitimate 
right to self -defense of a sovereign state is a contradictory act as it denies the  basic 
spirit of the UN Charter whic h clearly stipulate sovereign equality and 
non-interference as well as the recognized rules governing international relations.  
The UNSC is not fully discharging its missions and responsibilities to 
safeguard internationa l peace and security. Th e main reaso n exactly lies in the 
unjust and double -dealing acts of the U.S. and some UN member states following 
in the footsteps of the U.S.  
The UNSC does not say even a word about the high -handedness and 
arbitrariness, reckless ar ms build -up and war crim es of the U. S., but only picks a 
quarrel with the DPRK at every chance in its righteous efforts to bolster national 
self-defense capabilities.  
All of these show that the UNSC has lost its competency and authority to act 
on behalf of  the UN member states wh en it perfor ms its duty to maintain 
international peace and security.  
As long as the double standards, unfairness, high -handedness and 
arbitrariness of the U.S. are not removed, any decisions or resolutions adopted by 
the UNSC can n either have reasonable b inding force  nor contribute to ensuring 
global peace and security.  
In order to put an end to the high -handedness and arbitrariness of specific 
countries including the U.S. and restore confidence of the international community 
in the  UNSC, urgent priority s hould be giv en to the expansion and strengthening 
 of representation of developing countries which account for the absolute majority 
of the UN membership.  
If the UN is to ensure impartiality and objectivity in its activities, i t should 
regard it as a strict  rule to res pect the principles of sovereign equality and the 
rights to equality and self -determination of the people.  
The US and some other UN member states are trying to unilaterally impose 
on sovereign states the Western va lues and the “rules -based inte rnational or der” 
behind the signboards of “safeguarding democracy” and “protecting human rights”. 
Such interventionist attempt constitutes a flagrant breach of the UN Charter which 
gives precedence to the principle of sovereig n equality.  
The impartial acts  and double standards leaning to the unfair positions of 
some individual countries and the specific forces should be thoroughly eliminated. 
And the principles of the UN Charter, the core of which are the sovereign equality 
and the equal rights and self -determination o f the peoples, should be strictly 
observed.  
The DPRK delegation takes this opportunity to extend firm support and 
solidarity to the government and people of Cuba in their struggle to safeguard their 
sovereignty and  the right to development of t he country i n the face of the 
high-handedness and arbitrariness of the U.S. in a move to interfere in its internal 
affairs. We also strongly demand that all the economic and financial embargoes on 
Cuba by the U.S. be lifted im mediately as required by relev ant resoluti ons of the 
UN General Assembly.  
We also stand in support and solidarity with the people of Syria, Palestine 
and other independent countries who are struggling to repel interference of foreign 
forces and safeguard t heir independence, sovereignty  and territo rial integrity.  
Mr. President,  
It is the invariable foreign policy stand of the DPRK government to maintain 
independence, peace and friendship. 
 The DPRK will broadly cooperate with all countries and nations which 
oppose and reject aggression an d interferen ce, domination and subordination and 
aspire after independence and justice, transcending differences in ideology and 
system. It will also develop multifaceted exchanges and cooperation even with the 
capitalist coun tries that respect our country  and take fr iendly attitude to it.  
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea sets great store by sovereign 
equality and international  justice. It will, in the future, too, actively join the 
international community in its efforts to maintain world peace and  security an d 
establish a fair and just international order. And it will fulfil its responsibilities and 
role in ensuring peace and s ecurity on the Korean peninsula.  
Thank you.",PRK,2022

Your Excellency, Mr. Csaba Kőrösi , President of the 
77th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,  
Your Excellency, Mr. António Guterres, Secretary -
General of the United Nations,  
Heads of State and Government,  
Distinguished Delegates,  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
It is a great honor to take the floor in this majestic hall of 
multilateral diplomacy on behalf of His Excellency João 
Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço, President of the Republic of 
Angola, who wished to be here in person to address your 
Excellencies b ut was unable to due to the general elections 
of August 24th and to his swearing in ceremony.  
However, His Excellency, President João Manuel 
Gonçalves Lourenço, entrusted me to greet all those 
present, especially Your Excellency Csaba Kőrösi  and to 
congra tulate you on your election as President of the 77th 
Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and 
 to assure you of the support of the Republic of Angola 
during your presidency.   
Your Excellencies,  
This session, with the theme “A Decisive Mom ent: 
Transformative  Solutions  to Interrelated  Challenges ”, 
takes place during a unique and sensitive international 
moment in our modern history, where we face complex 
challenges that call for joint solutions.     
The world faces persistent and cyclical cha llenges, which 
have been exacerbated in recent years by the international 
health situation brought about by the Covid -19 pandemic; 
the emergence of growing threats to the economy, peace 
and global security; as well as the impacts of climate 
change.  
The Re public of Angola has defended at international 
forums the importance of multilateralism and international 
cooperation that are mutually advantageous and beneficial 
to the relations between States, whether large or small, 
developed or developing, because in  our understanding this 
is the way that we can effectively contribute to the search 
 for consensus solutions in resolving political, economic, 
social and cultural crises.  
World peace, which we all aim to achieve, will only come 
about through peace -building  efforts in every country.  In 
this regard, the Republic of Angola continues to make 
important efforts to contribute to peace and stability on the 
African continent and in its sub -region in particular.  
In its role presiding the International Conference on  the 
Great Lakes Region, the Republic of Angola has spared no 
effort to contribute to peace and stability in the region, 
especially with respect to the conflict in the Central African 
Republic, but also with regards to the border dispute 
between Rwanda and  the DRC as well as between Uganda 
and Rwanda, where we have modestly tried to do our best, 
since, as we know, the solution always and above all 
depends on the political will of the parties directly involved, 
as His Excellency, the President of the Republi c of Angola, 
João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço  recently reminded us. 
 Your Excellencies,  
Angola's efforts at peace -building on the African continent 
merited the special recognition of the African Union, which 
designated the President of the Republic of Angola, João 
Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço , an “African Union 
Champion for Peace and Reconciliat ion"", during the 
Extraordinary Summit on “terrorism and unconstitutional 
changes of Governments in Africa,” which demonstrates 
our country's commitment to mediation and consensus in 
resolving political crises in Africa and around the World.  
These efforts have been galvanized by the support we have 
received from the UN Secretary General, H.E. Mr. Antonio 
Guterres. Angola will continue to work closely with the 
United Nations and the African Union in peace and 
consensus building efforts in order to resolve co nflicts, with 
a view toward achieving a culture of peace, security and 
stability, at the SADC, ECCAS, ICGLR  levels, as well as in 
the Gulf of Guinea and other regional organizations. 
 The Republic of Angola continues to uphold the inalienable 
rights of al l States to strengthen their own defense 
capabilities against external threats, equipping their Armed 
Forces with men, weapons and equipment that meet 
national needs. In this regard, we reiterate here our call for 
the lifting of the arms embargo imposed on  the Central 
African Republic.  
Your Excellencies,  
History has taught us that we must discourage the use of 
force to resolve conflicts that may exist between sovereign 
nations, as the consequences for humanity are 
immeasurable.  
Based on the principle of non -alignment enshrined in the 
constitution of the Republic of Angola, our country 
advocates for conflict resolution through dialogue and 
respect for International Law.  
The political -military conflicts and the existing and 
persis tent disparities in the economic and technological 
development spheres between world regions and 
geographic blocks represent a permanent threat and, at the 
 same time, an opportunity for all humanity to join forces for 
their peaceful resolution.  
Once more, Angola urges the end of the economic embargo 
against Cuba, and the removal of unilateral measures and 
sanctions against the Cuban people, which impedes their 
country’s harmonious economic, social, and technical -
scientific development.  
In general, Angola d efends the lifting of all unilateral 
sanctions or coercive measures imposed against the 
peoples of Zimbabwe and Venezuela, among others, 
without a mandate from the Security Council.  
These politically motivated measures have proven to be 
counterproductive to efforts to eradicate poverty and to 
implement the Sustainable Development Goals, and they 
violate the principles of the United Nations Charter and of 
international public and humanitarian law.  
Your Excellencies,  
Negotiations for reforming the UN Security Council still 
have not produced the results that the overwhelming 
majority of Member States expects. 
 The Republic of Angola joins other voices that defend such 
reform toward an equitable representation that refl ects the 
current configuration of the United Nations.  
The Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration 
represent a viable option to restore the rights and legitimate 
aspirations of the African continent and to correct the 
historical injustices that the reg ion is experiencing with its 
absence from the decision -making center of one of the main 
statutory bodies in matters of international peace and 
security created by the United Nations Charter.  
Your Excellencies,  
Angola held its fifth general elections on August 24th 
characterized by an environment of peace, harmony and 
transparency, thus consolidating the construction of a 
democratic State and the rule of law, with a view toward the 
country’s socio -economic develo pment. The newly -elected 
Government intends to continue to work on ongoing 
reforms based on the deepening of democratic norms and 
the rule of law, and the well -being of our people. The 
 Government will continue to fight corruption as one of the 
main priorit ies of this mandate.  
Your Excellencies,   
The Republic of Angola is aligned with the international 
consensus on sustainable development, including the 
African Union Agenda 2063 on the environment. It has 
approved the National Strategy on climate change and  
environmental education and plans to achieve the target of 
70% energy from non -polluting sources by 2025, favoring 
clean hydroelectric and solar energy.  
To this end, numerous and significant investments have 
been made in economic and social infrastructur e to mitigate 
the effects of a prolonged drought that has affected the 
southern region of Angola, with special emphasis on the 
inauguration in 2022 of an Aqueduct in the Province of 
Cunene, which provides access to water to 350 thousand 
citizens over a spa n of 160 kilometers, thus ensuring the 
supply for people, cattle, and irrigation.  
In conclusion, Mr. President, allow me to announce that the 
Republic of Angola will host the 10th Summit of the 
Organization of African, Caribbean and Pacific States 
 (OACPS),  on December 6 -10, 2022, in Luanda, at a time 
when the challenges that the international community faces 
are increasingly complex and require engagement and 
solidarity from all of us in order to overcome them.  
Our purpose in convening this summit and assum ing the 
presidency of the organization is to endeavor to allow the 
OACPS, now a full -fledged international organization, to 
play its role in the concert of nations.  
Therefore, we would like to count on the attendance and 
participation of all its Member St ates.  
 
Thank you.", AGO,2022
 NRU_77_2022,"Page 1 of 6   Statement for His Excellency Lionel Rouwen Aingimea M.P., President of the Republic of Nauru United Nations General Assembly 77th Session to be delivered by Ms. Josie-Ann Dongobir, Chargé d’Affaires  Mr. President,  It is an honour to represent His Excellency Lionel Rouwen Aingimea and deliver this statement for the Republic of Nauru at the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly. On behalf of the government and people of the Republic of Nauru, allow me to congratulate Your Excellency, Mr. Csaba Kőrösi on your assumption of the Presidency of the General Assembly for the 77th session. Let me assure you of my delegation’s full cooperation and support as you lead this august body in seeking transformative solutions to our shared interlocking challenges. Allow me to also thank His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid of the Maldives, for his exceptional stewardship of this august body during the 76th session, and note the many successful initiatives undertaken during his tenure, including the Presidency of Hope Fellowship. Nauru was privileged to have one of its young officials participate in this pioneering Fellowship. Mr. President,  We come together at a critical moment created by three interconnected crises: the COVID pandemic and its consequences, the war in Ukraine, and a tipping point in climate change.  These crises are creating unprecedented humanitarian challenges, as well as growing concerns about the global economy.  To overcome these challenges, and to fulfill the promises of the 2030 Agenda, we must draw upon the strength of multilateralism and the ability of this organization to bring about transformative change that builds our people’s resilience to face the crises of today and of the future. This time last year, Nauru was proud to declare its COVID free status. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. Thankfully however, with the strong support of our partners, Nauru was able to achieve high vaccination rates for both adults and children. Our high vaccination rates have been critical in ensuring minimal casualties from the COVID infection. We thank our partners Australia,Page 2 of 6  India, Japan, Switzerland, and the United States including the COVAX Facility for their support throughout the pandemic. We would also like to acknowledge in particular the support and good practices demonstrated by the people of Taiwan in the face of COVID. The Republic of China (Taiwan) is an important partner in the global response to the pandemic, as well as a particular partner of Nauru. Taiwan’s exemplary response and assistance should not be ignored. Taiwan is ready to share their experience and we call for their recognition to ensure their right to engage with us all in this global forum.  With the help of our partners and friends, the health effects of COVID on our country have been relatively mild.  Despite this achievement, we note with deep concern the growing global resistance to vaccinations, alongside a rise in misinformation and fear mongering through both social and mainstream media platforms. Vaccine resistance and misinformation puts us all at risk not only for COVID but for other diseases, as evidenced through global outbreaks of measles and polio. In our interconnected world, we know that no one, and no country, is safe until everyone is safe. We need practical and collaborative solutions to combat the dangerous trend of misinformation for the sake of global health.  As we have seen too many times in Nauru, in our deeply connected world, an outbreak in one corner can produce a ripple of destruction that can touch us all.   Mr. President, To build our resilience domestically, Nauru prioritizes a preventative strategy for public health. Our strategy is informed by the lessons learned during this pandemic and we continue to seek support to review, overhaul and revamp our health systems, and to thereby develop innovative solutions to our needs. Moreover, to address the challenges of today and tomorrow, our health system needs to be climate resilient, with the capacity for viral risk management through e-medicine, digital technology, and more. Meeting our ambition will require partners to provide support and technical expertise.  Beyond communicable diseases, other health challenges plague small island developing states thus undermining our chances of a sustainable and healthy future where no one is left behind. The battle against non-communicable diseases is one battle we have little odds of winning due to ongoing challenges with food security and nutrition, as well as weak policies, strategies, and capacities to adequately address substance use and abuse. There must be wholesale transformation of the food system to eradicate food insecurity and malnutrition.  Incremental measures such as trainings, workshops and kitchen gardens alone cannot meet the needs. We call on the UN and our partners to focus their efforts and help us towards securing affordable nutritious food for all.   Mr. President, We also take this opportunity to thank the Government of Cuba for their longstanding commitment to strengthening our health sector through the work of their medical brigades. Despite the assistance they provide to many, the Cuban people continue to suffer from the economic, commercial, and financial embargo of the United States. We call on the United States to not forget the friendly people of Cuba who are also struggling like us under this pandemic.Page 3 of 6   Mr. President,  Education holds the key to unlocking the transformative solutions we so urgently need to address the interlocking challenges of today’s world. Education holds the mold for shaping the future we want and need. We must leave this week and the Transforming Education Summit not only inspired and energized by the passion of young people, but with concrete ideas and partnerships to take home and implement.  Quality education for all will require both creativity and urgent action, to tackle immediate needs and build towards long-term transformation. We have the opportunity now to reimagine education and invest in new approaches.  We join calls for global efforts to review and revamp our education delivery models – with a view to improving teacher attraction and retention strategies, strengthening partnerships between the homes and the school as well as the development of inexpensive, alternate models of delivery. Mr. President,  When we speak of transformation and resilience, we must prioritize the Climate emergency, where the Pacific is on the front lines.   Climate change continues to ravage our planet, and the global community has once again failed to take the actions required to curb its spread. We can no longer continue to debate the human impact on our planet and when and if we will band together to mount a fight against the climate emergency and its undeniable security implications.  The maintenance of international peace and security demands that we unite with a shared understanding of the threats and challenges we face.  Nauru continues its call upon the Secretary General to appoint a Special Representative on Climate and Security, and to immediately undertake an assessment of the UN’s capacity to respond to climate disasters.  Climate change has infiltrated every aspect of our lives and as such our response must be equally diverse and robust. While we are hopeful for COP27, we are not naïve to the reality that work in this arena is far from the urgency and scale required. Major emitters are lacking in both commitment and action to reduce emissions.  We need stronger commitments and actions which move past pretty words on paper.   Nauru, like other island nations have lived with the realities of climate change for some time now. Climate change undermines and threatens the ability of Governments and institutions to deliver basic services in the short and long-term. The Higher Ground Initiative (HGI) is crucial to our ability to reclaim land that is now unusable. Land that presents us both with an urgent need and an expensive financing venture, hence we seek both financial and technical assistance for the completion and implementation of the Masterplan for a pilot plot. If successful, this pilot plot can transform the future of Nauru, ensuring that our homeland can continue for generations to come.Page 4 of 6  There also remains a serious and pressing need for climate resilient infrastructure.  Nauru faces significant delays in its port redevelopment project. A project that represents both a crucial domestic need and an international example of climate resilient infrastructure. However, consequent of the pandemic, Nauru now faces unprecedented delays and unforeseen added costs beyond its national capacities.  We join other vulnerable nations in the call for practical financial solutions to these unforeseen challenges to key adaptation measures.  Mr. President,  Global transformation demands a global energy transition.  And we welcome the ongoing work from the High-Level Dialogue on Energy and work being undertaken to meet SDG7.   A just and inclusive energy transition requires that no one, and no country, is left behind, and reaching these goals will require international financial and technical support. Moreover, it will require that we rethink how we get energy.  And where that energy comes from.   We cannot expect the trajectory of global emissions to drop without access to viable energy alternatives. Deep sea minerals provide us with a solution. Polymetallic nodules will transform big and small countries’ energy systems with an accessible alternative and a pathway to a just energy transition.  This is a priority for Nauru at the International Seabed Authority, and we continue to call for more support and investment to ensure the establishment and adherence to robust governance mechanisms in this field. We must not lose focus towards our shared goals of a just and inclusive energy transition as we work to complete the two-year timeline to establish the global regulatory framework for deep seabed minerals.  Mr. President,  Nauru is a big ocean state. We are people of the ocean, and our lives are inextricably linked to the Pacific Ocean. The ocean has shaped who we are as it has similarly shaped the nations and peoples of other small island developing states. But we must transform our relationship with the ocean if it is to continue to sustain us and future generations.   We express our disappointment that the work of the Fifth Session of the Intergovernmental Conference on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction was not completed.  We are committed to overcoming issues of divergence in these negotiations. Issues that are very important to island nations like the special circumstances and shared vulnerabilities of small island developing states must be recognized – this is not new.   We must also come to consensus on benefit sharing on the high seas, especially as it relates to marine genetic resources. This is crucial for the economic diversity of island nations and is an integral part of the blue economy.  Finally, we raise as we have before, the critical importance of ensuring sustainable fisheries.  This includes ensuring that overfishing is not taking place, that fair prices are paid to small islands for fish taken from our water, and that we eliminate illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.Page 5 of 6  Mr. President,  Nauru remains committed to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and the Paris Agreement. These historic agreements outline our shared optimism for the future, and they provide us with the means and metrics to reach our ambition.  However, they are in danger of not being worth the paper they are printed on without adequate and predictable support from the international community as Nauru and many island nations will not be able to realize the Sustainable Development Goals, nor to adapt, and mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change.  The ability to access sustainable financing, determines whether we succeed or fail. Nauru, like many SIDS face barriers to sustained economic growth due to our geographic remoteness, small scale of our economy, vulnerabilities to climate change, external economic and financial shocks and the rules that govern development assistance.  For years small island developing states have reiterated the limitations of the per capita income as a measure of development. This arbitrary measure does not adequately consider our special circumstances and unique vulnerabilities.  Nauru stresses the importance of the on-going work on the Multi-Dimensional Vulnerability Index and reiterate the importance of its establishment. Though the process of finalizing and adopting the MVI has moved at a slower rate than anticipated or desired, we nonetheless thank and commend the High-Level Panel for their ongoing work thus far. Undoubtedly, crucial work such as the MVI cannot be hurried. In this light, Nauru calls for Member States to universally agree and adopt the MVI once finalized, thus contributing to making sure that the needs of the most vulnerable are tailored to as required.  Mr. President,  As we commemorate the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, Nauru as a state party to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, encourages those member states who have yet to ratify the TPNW to do so, so we are united in the global goal for a peaceful and just world free of nuclear weapons.   We are facing a time of great risk and uncertainty. This can, however, also be a time of opportunity and transformation.  To ensure the “No one is Left Behind”, our joint post-pandemic recovery efforts must be embedded and upheld in institutions and practices of good governance. We must be careful to not compromise on good governance practices under pressures to build back faster and better. We reiterate our commitment to the principles of good governance as we undertake our national general elections, and we call on Member States to observe and actively strengthen and promote good governance both domestically and internationally.
